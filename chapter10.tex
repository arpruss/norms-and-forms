\section{Introduction}
I have argued that in order to explain a large multitude of normative and metaphysical features 
of reality, especially of the human being, we would do well to posit a metaphysically robust 
entity, a nature or form, in each substance, and especially in human beings. This form is extremely rich 
in informational content (which is further evidence for the need for a robust treatment of it), 
as it has to answer a very large number of Mersenne questions in ethics, epistemology, semantics,
and metaphysics.

But the theory so far is highly underspecified. The point of this chapter is to tentatively specify 
the theory further in terms of both teleology and fundamental metaphysics. 

\section{Teleology}
\subsection{Parts and aspects}
When my arm is functioning poorly due to an injury, I am functioning poorly insofar
as I have an arm. It it tempting to reduce evaluations of the function or flourishing
of a part of a substance to the function or flourishing of the whole in respect of the
part. But while this is tempting, there is good reason to resist this reduction.

Of course, everyone agrees that there are cases where the flourishing or languishing of a part or aspect is
instrumental to the opposite state of the whole. Xenophon has Socrates give the example of a 
person who is harmed by their wisdom because a tyrant hears about the wisdom and has the
wise person kidnapped to serve as an adviser.??ref And many a person would have escaped a broken
leg sustained if they had a minor sprain that kept them from skiing. 

But there are more interesting cases where the flourishing state of a part seems not merely instrumental to 
the opposite flourishing state of the whole, but constitutive of it. Muscles are torn down by exercise
and regrow stronger. The process of tearing down is harmful to the muscles themselves, but is a constitutive 
part of the proper functioning of the body's system of adaptation to particular activities. And, more
generally, the death of cells is part and parcel of the normal self-renewing persistence of a multi-cellular
organism.

These cases are perhaps not entirely convincing. One might insist that when cells die as part of the self-renewal
of the organism, the death is itself a part of the proper functioning of the cell, and hence both the cell and the
whole are flourishing. Historically, Aristotelians have tended to insist that a thing's destruction is bad
for it.???refs However, this may be mistaken. If we think of substances as four-dimensional objects---spatiotemporal
entities---then a thing is destroyed just in case it has an upper temporal boundary. Now, having \textit{spatial} 
boundaries is not bad for a thing---indeed, having spatial boundaries of the right sort is constitutive of a thing's
having the correct shape and size. A dog so bloated as to be boundless, taking up the whole universe, would not be a 
healthy dog! Similarly, a substance of a specific sort could have proper temporal boundaries, and if so, it might be harmed not just by
living too short a time, but also by living too long a time.\footnote{
Whether it is a part of human flourishing to have an upper temporal boundary or whether humans better flourish
in living forever is a difficult
question whose thorough discussion is beyond the scope of this book. We can note that human beings 
pursue projects that  are at least typically cut short by death, and their pursuit of such projects 
is a part of their flourishing. Moreover, there is reason to doubt that a satisfactory degrees of virtue, wisdom, 
and understanding of the world, and a sufficiently broad array of deep friendships are practically 
attainable in a typical human lifespan, which points to the idea that it is not good for us that our upper
temporal boundary be at death (on the
other hand, see ??refs), and hence points towards life after death given Aristotelian optimism.} It is plausible that typical human cells have 
proper temporal boundaries as well, and hence their living too long may be bad for the organism as a whole
\textit{and} for the cell as a part.

Cases of redundancy may provide a more convincing example of where the flourishing of a part comes apart from
the partial flourishing of the whole. Suppose that an organism for its basic functioning needs $n_1$ functioning parts of some sort---say,
cells of a particular kind, or legs, or teeth---and for the sake of redundancy it needs some large number $n_2$.
Suppose that having more than $n_2$ is supernormal for the organism (as per our discussion in ??backref), until we
reach some large number $n_3$ at which point the organism has too much.  

For the sake of definiteness, suppose that the parts are teeth of some hypothetical organism that does not
have a precisely prescribed number of teeth, and that $n_1$ is 30, $n_2$ is 35, and $n_3$ is 40. With fewer
than 30 teeth, the organism fails to chew well. With 35 to 39, it has a healthy level of redundancy. And at 40 or more,
it has too many teeth. Suppose now that Sally is an organism of this sort and she has 38 teeth. One of the teeth, however,
is getting worn down quite a bit. That tooth is no longer fully functional, and hence that tooth is failing to flourish.
However, this does not constitute any failure of flourishing in Sally. Even if the tooth stopped functioning entirely,
Sally would still have sufficient dentation both for first-order purposes and for redundancy. Sally can still be fully
functioning as a whole with respect to her teeth, even though that tooth is not itself fully functioning, and even though
she would be fully functioning to a higher degree if that tooth were to fully function. In this case, the direction of
flourishing of the part and of the whole seems to be the same, but nonetheless one can have full flourishing of the whole
without every part fully flourishing. In such a case, it would not be correct to say that Sally is languishing with respect
to that tooth. For that tooth doesn't make her languish---it just makes her flourish less.

Interestingly, redundancy can be between parts or aspects of very different sorts. We might suppose that a flourishing human 
being has a sufficient number of abilities of various sorts. These abilities can be moral, intellectual, emotional, or physical, and
within each category, they can differ quite significantly from each other. Then full flourishing could turn out to be compatible with a severe
impairment within certain abilities---for instance, one's mathematical aptitudes might be dysfunctional, and yet the \textit{person} 
might fully flourish. This would allow an Aristotelian to accept the thesis that some persons with significant disabilities can nonetheless
be fully flourishing.??refs For the disability can constitute the failure of a part or aspect of the person to flourish, without
thereby compromising flourishing of the whole. 

We could, in principle, suppose that there are some cases where the failure of flourishing of a part might not even make the 
whole flourish less. Going back to Sally, perhaps 37 teeth is better than 38 (maybe 37 makes for better fit within the jaw),
even though any number from 36 to 39 is fully normal. In that case, if Sally's 38th tooth is starting to deteriorate, this could
be moving her to an even better state. 

At the same time, there are proper parts and aspects such that the flourishing of the part or aspect always lines up with the
flourishing of the whole. In the case of a person, to have one's will flourish in an action is to flourish with respect to the 
will, and makes one better off with that respect, and hence we do not need to correct looser discussion earlier in this book where
no distinction was made between flourishing with respect to the will and having one's will flourish. Plausibly, rationality is similar. 
One is always better off for being more moral and more rational, and a failure of flourishing of one's morality is a failure of the 
person as a whole. 

How much of the above logically possible differentiation between flourishing of the part and partial flourishing of the whole is 
realized in humans is a question for further investigation. However,
we see that the teleological structure of a substance and its parts and aspects can be quite conceptually complex. If we take
the form to be the ground of the essentials of that structure (???what of contingent forms), then this makes for even more work 
for form.

\subsection{Teleological reduction}
\subsubsection{A multiplicity of concepts}
The applications given in this book make use of various normative concepts that are said to be grounded in forms,
such as proper function, teleology, and flourishing. It would be good to investigate if these 
can be further unified, under either one of these concepts, or some further unifying concept.

First, as we have seen in the discussion of the supererogatory and supernormal, we have both binary and comparative normative 
concepts, often in the same context. Suppose a stranger is about to be hit by a train, and the only four options are:

\ditem{kick}{give them a kick to ensure that they have no chance of survival}
\ditem{fun}{make fun of them}
\ditem{idle}{stand by idly}
\ditem{jump}{jump in and push them out of the way likely at the cost of one's own life.} 

The binary distinction is that
the first two options are impermissible, and the other two are permissible. But there is a comparative distinction
as well: \dref{kick} is worse than \dref{fun}, and \dref{jump} is better than \dref{idle}. The binary distinction does not reduce to
degree of comparison: while \dref{fun} is much worse than \dref{idle}, \dref{idle} is much worse than \dref{jump} (though 
it is more natural to say that \dref{jump} is much better than \dref{idle}). And the comparisons do not reduce to the binary 
characterizations.

Proper function and teleology appear to be primarily binary concepts: a thing functions properly or improperly, and a thing either 
does or does not achieve its end. Flourishing, on the other hand, seems to comprise both the binary and the comparative. The mildly
vicious person unjustly suffering horrendous pain appears not to be flourishing \textit{simpliciter}, but if the pain were increased,
they would languish more. Flourishing thus appears the best candidate for a foundational concept for our norms.

But because the notion of ends and teleology has been so important in the Aristotelian tradition, both in the case of voluntary 
action and involuntary activity, it is worth thinking some more about ends.

\subsubsection{Ends}
Many activities seem to occur for an end. The activity then counts as successful provided that the end occurs and occurs as a
fulfillment of the activity. An organism produces gametes in order to reproduce. A cat chases birds in order to catch them,
and eats them for nourishment. And I put on shoes to keep my feet comfortable when I walk. The end-directedness of much voluntary
activity is obvious, but whether there really is teleology in the involuntary cases is more controversial, though highly intuitive.

The Aristotelian tradition tends to analyze voluntary action as always end-directed, but also tends to see involuntary activity as 
often, if not always, directed at an end. I will argue, starting with the case of voluntary action, that many interesting phenomena 
would be misclassified as end-directed. The actual structure can be more complex, and while it has a directional structure, it is
misleading to think of that structure as teleological in the sense of possessing a ``target \textit{telos}'', an aim-to-be-achieved,
an end that fulfills it.

Consider a sprinter who is running a hundred meters all out against a clock, rather than against other opponents. The runner has an end, 
namely to sprint 100 meters. But sprinting 100 meters does not explain the intense effort the runner puts in. Less than half of the effort 
could have been put in, and 100 meters would still have been sprinted. The bulk of the runner's effort is explained by being directed 
not at completing the sprint but at completing it in minimum time.

But what state of affairs does the runner's speed-directed effort have as its end? A runner might have a particular target time in mind.
However, we are imagining a runner who runs all out. A runner who is just aiming at a particular time could slow down if it became obvious
that a slower run would still achieve the target time, but not so our all-out runner. Our sprinter may have some specific time in mind
to motivate themselves, but interpreting their action as merely aiming at that time does not capture all of the directional structure 
of the performance. Any shortening of the time of the run is welcome given the sprinter's aims. 

We would normally describe the runner as trying to run 100 meters ``as fast as possible'', and that seems to be a coherent description
of an end. However, the language of ``as fast possible'' should not be taken literally. First, we have the question of what the relevant
comparison class is. Is the runner trying to run as fast as any human being can on any track? This seems an excessively
grandiose aim. As fast as they themselves can run on this track on this occasion? But then what aspects of ``this occasion'' are 
fixed (e.g., the level of motivation)? And what if there is no maximum to these things, but only an upper bound that cannot be reached, much like
an object with mass can come arbitrarily close to the speed of light but cannot achieve that speed.

Second, suppose we fix a particular sense of ``as fast as possible'', and then after ten meters the runner realizes that they have
been slightly slower than is possible. At this point, it is no longer possible for the runner to achieve the goal of literally running
the run as fast as possible. But we do not expect the runner to stop. We expect the runner to resume running all-out, as part of the
same directed activity.

There is obviously a teleological structure to the sprinter's run. But it is not a structure of aiming to \textit{achieve} a 
target \textit{telos}. 
We can think of this structure that of a preference structure: a faster time is always preferred to a lower time. 
Such preference structures are common in games, where we ourselves have defined the teleology, but we can also find them in the 
case of teleologies that are not our own invention. For instance, suppose the human mind aims at understanding. If we understand
this in terms of aim at a target \textit{telos}, the understanding of everything or of everything humanly understandable, then as soon as 
we realize that we cannot have this (for there are humanly understandable things that I cannot understand because they have faded to much
into the past---facts about the taste of dodo birds, for instance), the pursuit would become pointless. 

It is better to say that our teleological orientation sets an ordering on our understanding, where understanding a set
$B$ of items is better for us than understanding a set $A$ of items whenever $A$ is a proper subset of $B$ (every item in $A$ is
in $B$, but not \textit{vice versa}) and when the levels of understanding for each item are kept fixed. This ordering then obviously
affects our epistemic lives, but also our practical ones (since one needs to make sacrifices in order to understand).

There even seem to be cases outside of rational activity where we have a teleological directedness not understood in terms of the pursuit of a specific \textit{telos}. 
A pecan tree produces pollen in order to have offspring. The more offspring, the better! Again, the 
\textit{telos} is not to have infinitely many offspring\footnote{One might suppose that there is a limit here based on how much offspring
it is possible for one pecan tree to have. But it is not clear that there is such a limit in principle. Wouldn't a pecan tree always be better
off if it lived an extra year and had more offspring (perhaps transported to another planet, to avoid overcrowding)?}, but rather the teleology
seems best understood in terms of a preference ordering: more offspring, keeping the health of the offspring constant, is better.

As an alternative we might suppose that we just have infinitely many target \textit{tel\^e} in one organism: to understand the truth or falsity $p_1$, 
and to understand the truth and falsity of $p_2$, and so on, for all the propositions that can be understood by humans, or to have
at least one offspring, and to have at least two offspring, and to have at least three offspring, and so on. But while I have argued that our form is 
complex, to suppose such infinite complexity seems excessive. Furthermore, it is plausible that each target \textit{telos} impels the organism
causally---e.g., pulling on us in our deliberation. But infinitely many such things causally influencing a single aspect of us would violate 
the principle of causal finitism defended recently by multiple authors??refs. Furthermore, each organism would always have infinitely 
many unfulfilled target \textit{tel\^e}, and that may seem just too pessimistic to believe.

It may, of course, sound oxymoronic to talk of a teleological structure without a target \textit{telos}. But that's a merely verbal point. We can
think of teleology as about pointing and directedness, without a \textit{target} as such. Imagine for instance that I am competing in an 
odd archery competition, where the winner is the one whose arrow hits closer to the center---except that if you hit the exact center, you
automatically lose. Then there is an obvious sense in which I am aiming. Indeed, since the chance of hitting the center is infinitesimal,
I should even set my bowsight on the center, but it is not correct to say that I am aiming to hit the center. 

Terminologically, we might either talk of teleology with a \textit{telos} (seemingly oxymoronically) or perhaps
more neatly distinguish between a target \textit{telos} and a directional \textit{telos}. A target \textit{telos} is
one that fulfills the striving when it is achieved. A directional \textit{telos} specifies a direction, but there need
not be a target to be hit. Sometimes a directional \textit{telos} can be formulated in terms of an unachievable 
``ideal target'', such as ``perfection'' or ``getting to the end of the track instantly''.  Imagine a golf course 
where the distance between a hole and the starting tee is so long that  a hole-in-one is humanly impossible. In the
first shot, the player may aim \textit{in the direction of} or \textit{towards} the hole, but it wouldn't be correct
to call the hole the target of the shot. The hole is an ``ideal target''. And sometimes there may even be no ideal target, just a direction. In an all-out timed one-mile run, if one 
does not know about speed of light limits, the only specific ideal target would seem to be completing the run in zero
time, but that appears to be an incoherent description. Nonetheless, there is a directional \textit{telos} towards 
``shorter times''.

It is, parenthetically, interesting to note that this way of thinking of teleology damages a Kantian argument for why we should believe in 
an afterlife and God. The argument observes that we are unable to achieve complete virtue in this life. But since we cannot aim at
the impossible, and need to aim at virtue, we should suppose another life, and a being capable of ensuring that in that life virtue
is achievable. But a critic might use the above understanding of teleology to defend the idea that we have an unlimited 
directedness in the \textit{direction} of perfect virtue without a directedness at the \textit{achievement} of perfect virtue. (On the other 
hand, we might still try to rescue the Kantian argument by supposing that while perfect virtue may not be our end, 
there is such a thing as being \textit{virtuous on the whole} which is our an end of ours and which still is not
practically achievable in this life.) It may, of course, be the case that complete virtue is a target \textit{telos} as
Kant thinks---but that requires an argument that goes beyond the observation of our orientation in direction of
complete virtue.

\subsection{Interdependence}
I once saw a children's picture book with the
jarring line that pigs give us ham. In an Aristotelian setting, we can ask: Is it a \textit{telos} of a pig
to provide ham to predators or of a butterfly larva to be a host for the offspring of a parasitoid wasp? 

A positive answer fits particularly well with Aristotelian optimism, but an immediate reason for a negative 
response is the expectation that an organism's \textit{telos} be the organism's
own good. But being eaten is clearly not good for one. However this line of thought begs the question. 
If giving one's life for a member of another species is one's \textit{telos}, it is thus far good for one.
But one can do justice to the intuition being eaten isn't good for one by noting that even if providing
food for another could be good for one, it might not be good \textit{overall}. Aristotelian optimism 
implies a \textit{tendency} towards harmony within the teleology of a substance, but is compatible with
there being some \textit{tel\^e} that are in tension with one another, say to feed another and to survive.
In such a case, survival may take priority, and so its loss is an overall harm---but a lesser harm than if
the organism lost its life without benefiting another. 

The same multiple-\textit{tel\^e} line of thought responds to another objection to a positive answer to 
our question, namely that organisms tend to engage in behavior clearly aimed at preventing their becoming
food for another---they try to escape predation. Considered without regard for teleology, a pig engages
in activities that promote the predator's nutritive good---the pig eats and grows---and it engages
in other activities that oppose the predator's nutritive good---the pig runs off. Aristotelian optimism
sees a tie between activity and teleology. If so, then it is not clear that we should privilege higher
level behavior in figuring out teleology. Perhaps the pig's becoming nutritionally beneficial is indeed
a pursuit of a porcine \textit{telos} just as much as its running away is a pursuit of a different
\textit{telos}.\footnote{One might also argue that the a prey animal's running off prevents a population
implosion that would be harmful to the predators as well. (I am grateful to Dominic Pruss for this 
observation.)}

It is very plausible that sometimes the good of another individual of one's own kind is a \textit{telos}.
Parenthood is an obvious example: the existence and flourishing of one's offspring is a part of one's
own flourishing. But even in fairly primitive organisms, there seem to be cases that go beyond parenthood.
In slime mold colonies producing a fruiting body, the organisms forming the stalk of the fruiting body do
not themselves reproduce, but instead sacrifice their reproductive potential to elevate other organisms
and make them better able to reproduce. 

In cross-species symbiotic relationships, we may think that each organism only promotes the good of the 
other as a means to its own good, but we need not think this. We might think that each organism has the
other's flourishing as a part of its own \textit{telos}. 

That said, I still feel the intuitive force of the idea that it is implausible to think of the prey as having the
nourishment of a predator as a \textit{telos}. But even if we do not wish to go as far as to say that pigs'
have a ham-production teleology, we have room for a substantive and robust picture of teleologically supported
interdependence between species. Applied to humans, it would give us an Aristotelian reason for why the good of the earth ecosystem 
could be not merely a means to the human good, but partly constitutive of it, and could make a positive
contribution to environmental ethics. 

\section{Individual forms}
\subsection{Two views}
There is a long-standing scholarly debate whether Aristotle thinks forms are individual---numerically different ones for different members of 
the same kind---or jointly shared by all members of the same kind.??refs The shared form view at first sight seems rather 
more Platonic than Aristotelian, but as long as the shared form is immanent in the individuals and governs their functioning,
the view can count as Aristotelian. 

Most of the normative applications in this book work whether or not all humans share the numerically same form or merely 
an exactly similar one. However, individual forms might be thought to do better justice to intuitions about the personal 
nature of ethical obligation: on an individual form view, my obligations are grounded in something proper to \textit{me}. cf.??backref This is perhaps not too strong an argument, since the advocate of shared forms will also agree that our 
shared human form is a constituent of each individual human, even if it is the same one that is shared among humans, much 
as an organ can truly be a part of each of two conjoint twins. 

If we follow Aristotelian tradition and identify the mind with the form (or some aspects of the form), then a shared form 
view leads to Averroes' theory that we all have the same mind. If the will is part of the mind, then we get absurd consequences
about the lack of personal responsibility for our action, and in any case, the view is famously counterintuitive. However, 
there are two reasons this argument may not fully convince a contemporary Aristotelian metaphysician to embrace an individual
forms view. 

First, one might completely reject the identification of the mind with the form. While it is elegant to identify the mind with 
form, one might instead suppose the form defines the mind's teleology, and the mind is a physical or non-physical system 
structured by that teleology, perhaps along the lines of the teleological functionalism sketched in ??backref. Or, second,
one might take hold that the human mind has two parts: one part is the non-physical form and the other part is the brain.
On this view, the mind is only partially identified with the form. This allows different people to have numerically different
minds on a shared form view, because we have numerically different brains, and if $x$ and $y$ share one part but not another,
by Leibniz's Law they must be numerically distinct. 

However, there are some other considerations in favor of an individual forms view.

\subsection{Individual unity}
My nose and my heart are parts of the same human, while my nose and your stomach are not. What constitutes the 
difference? On an individual form view, there is an elegant Aristotelian answer: my nose and my heart are informed by the same
form, while my nose and your heart are not. This answer will obviously not do on a joint-form view.

Nor will it do to say that the difference is constituted by the fact that there is continuous human matter joing my nose with my
heart, since if you and I were conjoined twins, but conjoined neither by heart nor nose, my nose would be connected by continuous
matter with your heart, even though those would still not be the nose and heart of one human. 

One might try for a teleological account of the unity of the human being: my nose and my heart function together (the nose 
allows the entry of oxygen which is distributed by the heart). However, we are social animals, and teleological cooperation
crosses individual boundaries.

It could be that some other account friendly to joint-form Aristotelianism is available. But the simplicity and elegance of the
individual-form account of individual human unity is a reason to opt for the joint-form view.

\subsection{Distant conspecifics}
Suppose a shared form theory is true. Now, imagine that in our galaxy there is only one human being, Adam, and imagine that in 
a galaxy far, far away, God creates a humanoid comes into existence, with no genetic connection to Adam, but with a form that 
is just like Adam's: this form unifies matter in the same way as
Adam's form does, it imposes exactly the same norms on the form's owner as the human form does on Adam, and it causes the same
structure and behavior as the human form does for Adam. 

At this point we have a dilemma: either the form of this humanoid must be numerically the same as Adam's or not. Suppose it 
must be numerically the same as ours. Then somehow simply by creating something in a galaxy far, far away, God causes an
entity in \textit{our} galaxy---Adam's form---to become multilocated. This seems counterintuitive. 

Suppose that the form does not need to be numerically the same as Adam's. In that case, we have admitted that there can 
be numerically different forms with the same broadly functional features (including the normative functions). This 
means that the question of whether you and I have the  numerically same form is not settled by noting that the forms have 
the same functional features. Indeed, now the question whether your and my form is numerically different or the same becomes
a metaphysical question that no empirical data is relevant to the settling of. There is nothing absurd about there being
such metaphysical questions. But it is some advantage to a theory if raises fewer such questions, having fewer degrees of 
freedom. And if one does accept a theory where it is possible but not logically necessary that different individual substances
have numerically different forms, then one really shouldn't be accepting that in practice you and I share a form. At best
one should be agnostic on this question.

\section{Accidental normative forms}
If you have promised to $\phi$, you should $\phi$. Consider two Aristotelian metaphysical explanations of what is going on here.
On the conditional-norm explanation, the human form contains the conditional norm that you should $\phi$ if you have promised 
to $\phi$, which when combined with the fact that you have promised to $\phi$ grounds an obligation to $\phi$. But there is
another possible explanation. Perhaps promising to $\phi$ causes, perhaps in virtue of a power contained in the human form, 
the normative accident of being such that you ought to $\phi$ to come into existence. One might think of the second story as 
a very robust normative power theory: a theory on which normative powers are a type of causal power that brings into existence
an irreducible and new normative entity. (Most normative power theories do not consider normative powers to be a type of 
causal power.??refs) 

The conditional-norm account posits fewer entities, and insofar as this is the case, Ockham's razor favors it. And intuitively
it seems to be the right account of promissory obligations. If this account holds for all norms, then the human substantial form could be 
the only normative property of the human being---there would be no normative accidents.

Now, while the conditional-norm account for humans
posits fewer entities (i.e., forms), it makes the human form contain more information in the form of conditionals.
For instance, on the conditional-norm view, humans without a Y chromosome have a human nature that specifies what
range of physical developments that are normal expressions of the genes that are unique to the Y chromosome. On the 
normative accident view, it may be that humans with a Y chromosome also have an additional non-physical property governing
the expression of Y-based genes.\footnote{It's worth noting that both views are compatible with a broad variety of views on gender and 
transsexuality, since choosing between the metaphysics of the two views does not settle the question of what the range
of normal physical developments is. One might think that the normative accident view allows for a more conservative
theory on which there is a metaphysical component---an accidental form---that determines whether one is really male or female, 
an accident of maleness or an accident of femaleness.  But at the same time, the normative accident view enables one to have 
a metaphysical basis for the claim that one's real sex and/or gender fails to match one's biological constitution at birth.
It is also worth noting that for norms relevant to sex and/or gender, the conditional norm view could make the antecedents 
of the conditionals be facts about DNA (such as whether one has a Y chromosome) but could also make them involve facts about 
psychology and society. The metaphysics does not by itself settle the normative questions here.}

At the same time, the normative accident view of human beings involves significantly more in the way of \textit{causal} laws
presumably grounded in human causal powers, such as that when one makes a promise, a promissory-obligation
accident comes into existence, or when one has such-and-such DNA, then such-and-such an accident governing norms of gene expression
coms into existence. Moreover, since normative accidents are in large part defined by the norms they embody, the informational
complexity of the normative accident is presumably present in the causal power for its production---it is a power to produce an
accident of, say, being required to $\phi$.  Thus while we have reduced the \textit{normative} complexity in human nature, we have done 
so at the cost of \textit{causal} complexity, \textit{and} a multiplication of entities.

This last point does not apply to normative accidents that have a cause outside of the human being. But it is difficult to think
of examples, with the exception of one theological possibility. According to many Christians/, by God's grace human beings
can be directed at the ``beatific vision'', a direct vision of God. This beatific vision exceeds the power of human
nature, and it is usually taken that natural human fulfillment does not require it. One way to make sense of this is to suppose
that God by grace gives all or some humans a normative accident of teleological directedness at the beatific vision, together
with the supernatural powers that lead in the direction of fulfillment of this telos. 

\section{$^*$Substances and quantum mechanics}
It is essential to our meta-normative applications that humans be substances and hence have forms. And given a view of 
human beings as having an organic teleology, it would be implausible to deny form to other organisms. Thus, organisms
have forms. What about inorganic reality? It appears to be central to Aristotelian metaphysics that all of reality be 
grounded in substances and their properties and relations. Inorganic aspects of reality---say, particles---that are 
part of an organism will be grounded in the organism, if we accept the classic Aristotelian thesis that substances 
cannot be proper parts of substances. Whether this thesis is correct is a question I will leave open in this book.

But in any case, that still leaves the vast amount of inorganic reality outside of any organisms, including particles, 
fields, rocks, mountains, planets, stars, galaxies, and so on. There has to be at least one inorganic substance to ground these.

On most interpretations of quantum mechanics there is no precise number of particles
in existence, as the universe is in a superposition of different states corresponding to different particle counts. Whether 
a substance exists, and what identity relations hold between substances, must be an objective fact. Aristotelianism cannot 
tolerate superpositions of different substance counts in reality. Thus, on most interpretations of quantum mechanics, particles
are not a good candidate for substances. The one exception is the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave interpretation (Bohmianism), on 
which there are particles or ``corpuscles'' with definite positions. If we have the intuition that particles are substances, 
that will support Bohmianism. 

The view radically opposite to a corpuscularian insistence on inorganic reality being partly grounded in substantial 
particles is to suppose that inorganic reality is grounded in some small number of global substances. This is an 
active area of research among Aristotelian philosophers of science, and a number of options are available. There 
could be a global ``wavefunction substance'' that grounds the values of the global quantum wavefunction, existing
over and beyond the organic substances. Alternately, one might suppose that a part of the information in the 
wavefunction of the universe is encoded in states of the organic substances, and the rest (i.e., vast majority) of 
the information is encoded in a global ``Swiss cheese substance'' that has holes corresponding to the organic substances. 

Alternately, one might try to ground the wavefunction substance in a number of small local point-like substances.
These could be points of three-dimensional space or of four-dimensional spacetime, and the wavefunction could be 
grounded in their relations.\footnote{$^*$In a non-relativistic setting, the wavefunction for $n$ particles that 
have position as their only property is a complex-valued function $\psi$ the phase space $\R^{3n}$. A point in $\R^{3n}$ can 
be identified as a sequence $(x_1,...,x_n)$ of $n$ points each in $\R^3$. We can then suppose that there is an 
$n$-ary determinable relation (``being co-wavefunctioned''?) between any $n$ points in $\R^3$, a determinate of which is 
quantified with a complex number, which complex number yields $\psi(x_1,...,x_n)$. If the points $x_1,...,x_n$ are 
substances, then these values are indeed grounded in relations between substances.} Or they could be points in a higher-dimensional
phase space, with the wavefunction grounded in their properties. 

A Bohmian view does not appear to escape the need for a grounding of the wavefunction, because the Bohmian corpuscles are 
governed in their behavior by the wavefunction, and their postulated properties like position are not sufficient to ground the values of the wavefunction. Thus, an Aristotelian Bohmianism does not appear particularly economical: it requires organic
substances, corpuscles, and a ground for the global wavefunction.

Interpretations of quantum mechanics can be by and large seen as responses to the measurement problem: the problem of 
what to do with the fact that naively applying the Schr\"{o}dinger equation to the initial conditions in many experimental 
setups generates the prediction of a wavefunction that contains a superposition of different macroscopic results, such as 
an instrument display showing one number and its showing a different number---something we never observe. Thus, in order 
to generate predictions compatible with what we actually see in the lab, something must be done. Responses 
divide into collapse and no-collapse interpretations. On both families,
we have a baseline deterministic evolution of the wavefunction over time according to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation.

On no-collapse interpretations, the baseline is all that happens, and as a result physical reality gets more and more 
superimposed. For instance, given the likely dependence of our solar system on quantum events in the early universe,
reality is in a superposition of our solar system having formed and our solar system not having formed. But that is 
not what we observe: we simply observe our solar system. One way to think about this is that the global wavefunction 
on a no-collapse interpretation describes something like a multiverse, in some branches of it there being a solar system and 
in others there not being one. We inhabit a branch where there is a solar system. 

If you toss a quantum mechanical coin, our branch splits into a branch with heads and a branch with tails. What happens
to you? There are six options:
\ditem{branch-neither}{You cease to exist.}
\ditem{branch-both}{You live in both a heads and a tails branch.}
\ditem{branch-heads-1}{You go to the heads branch and no one inhabits ``your'' position in the tails branch.}
\ditem{branch-heads-2}{You go to the heads branch and someone else\footnote{Presumably, a pre-existing person who had 
been co-located with you prior to the branch split.} inhabits ``your'' position in the tails branch.??many:minds}
\ditem{branch-tails-1}{You go to the tails branch and no one inhabits ``your'' position in the heads branch.}
\ditem{branch-tails-2}{You go to the tails branch and someone else inhabits ``your'' position in the heads branch.}

Both \dref{branch-neither} and \dref{branch-both} have a pleasing symmetry. However, both have a serious problem.
Suppose the coin is very unfair, so it has a $7/8$ chance of heads and a $1/8$ chance of tails. Now, on both 
\dref{branch-neither} and \dref{branch-none}, the two new branches are equally related to you---either neither is 
\textit{your} branch or both are \textit{yours}. But obviously prior to the toss, you should plan your future 
asymmetrically---you should expect to get heads. This asymmetry in planning does not fit with the metaphysics 
of the situation.\footnote{It may occurs to the reader to say that there are eight branches, one of them with 
tails and seven with heads. Then if you live in all eight branches, you might think it makes sense to plan 
``more'' for the more common branch. There is, however, a simple technical reason why this can't be the solution.
This solution only works when the chance of heads is a rational numbers, i.e., of the form $p/q$ with $p$ and $q$ integers.
But if the chance of heads is not a rational number, say because it is $1/\sqrt{2}$, there is no way to divide 
the branches in a ratio corresponding to the chances.} There is, of course, a large literature on this argument, with significant dispute??refs, but I will take the argument to provide significant support for the asymmetric metaphysical options. 

On the remaining four options, the wavefunction does not contain all the information about the universe, since the wavefunction
only says that there is a superposition between heads and tails, and does not tell you whether the individual who tossed
the coin goes into the heads branch (as on \dref{branch-heads-1} and \dref{branch-heads-2}) or into the tails branch (as on
the remaining two options). On these options, there is no problem with uneven chances: the chance of heads can determine 
how likely it is that one will get \dref{branch-heads-1} rather than \dref{branch-tails-1}, or that one will get 
\dref{branch-heads-2} rather than \dref{branch-tails-2}.

Thus, on a no-collapse view we have good reason to think there has to be more to reality 
than the wavefunction. Indeed, a no-collapse view points towards a metaphysics where some of the facts about 
reality are encoded in the wavefunction but others are encoded by the ``location'' of the agents in the multiverse.
This fits neatly with an ontology on which we have a global substance grounding the wavefunction and agents that 
move around in the multiverse.\footnote{For interpretations like this, see ??refs.}

On collapse interpretations, superposed states, such as a superposition between an electron being in one place and its 
being in another, are resolved indeterministically into pure states, say, the electron being in a specific place. The 
value of the wavefunction specifies the chance that a given superposed state will resolve into a given pure state. 
This collapse is an exception to the deterministic Schr\"{o}dinger equation.

On these interpretations, as far as the physics goes, it is possible to think the wavefunction describes all of physical 
reality if the situations that trigger collapse are themselves described by the wavefunction. The historically first collapse interpretations??Ref had collapse triggered by observation. This appears to require the prior existence of an observer. But if we think about 
the evolution of organisms capable of observations, this evolution itself depends on a vast number of quantum events (such 
as DNA mutations), and hence prior to the appearance of the first physical observer, all we have was a superposition 
of a state where an observer-like being had already evolved and a state where an observer-like being had not yet evolved. 
Thus, unless the existence of an observer is a fact over and beyond a wavefunction that codes for a superposition of 
observer-like states, observation-triggered collapse seems unable to get off the ground. Observation-triggered collapse,
thus, offers some support for an Aristotelian metaphysics where in additional to one or more substances grounding the 
wavefunction, we have some additional macroscopic substances that are observers. An interesting open question for such a theory 
would be what kind of interaction with a macroscopic substance counts as an observation. Do plants observe when they interact
with their environment, for instance? 

More recent collapse interpretations coming from physicists (e.g., Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory??ref) have collapse get triggered discretely or continuously by physical facts about the wavefunction. This is compatible with the wavefunction being a 
complete description of physical reality. These theories are empirically testable, but have not yet been 
tested.??refs If we find such a theory to be correct, an Aristotelian view that posits additional macroscopic substances 
beyond the substance or substances grounding the wavefunction will appear to be \textit{physically} otiose, though the
normative and semantic considerations of the earlier chapters will continue to be support it. Furthermore, standard 
arguments against physicalism in the theory of mind??ref-and-backref lend support to a richer ontology.

Anyway, other things being equal, no-collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics are preferable: they take the wavefunction 
to evolve under the elegant (and deterministic) Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The physically-based collapse theories modify this
evolution in a mathematically complicated way with one or more additional free parameters (such as a collapse rate and a
critical distance in the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber theory). Theories on which collapse is triggered by interaction with something
not at the level of physics, like organisms, at least seem to have the slight advantage of preserving the idea that when physics alone is in play,
we have the elegant Schr\"{o}dinger equation---collapse is triggered by interaction with something complex that is properly 
studied by other sciences than physics (e.g., biology or psychology). 

Thus it seems that when we think about quantum mechanics, a model of reality on which there are macroscopic substances like
oaks, sharks and people, and a further substance that (alone or in cooperation with the macroscopic substances) is needed
for grounding the wavefunction is not at all unnatural. On no-collapse models and non-physical collapse models, this theory 
answers a need that arises from the physics itself---a need to generate experimental measurements.
