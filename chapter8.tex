\section{Naturalism}
Is the Aristotelian hylomorphic account of humans compatible with naturalism? This depends on how naturalism
is defined and whether we take the theistic version of the account or not.

Since theism implies the existence of a non-natural causally efficacious substance, namely God, it will be incompatible
% with most versions of naturalism. And I have argued theat the Aristotelian account is unsatisfactory without
theism. 

Still, it is an interesting question whether the what the Aristotelian account says about the forms of finite
substances is compatible with naturalism. If so, then one could combine the Aristotelian account with 
a naturalism restricted to finite objects, and save some naturalistic intuitions. Furthermore, it would mean
that an Aristotelian not convined by the arguments that theism is needed to make the theory satisfactory could
be a full-blown naturalist.

If we take naturalism to say that the only entities in existence are the ones that would figure in a mature science,
then it is unlikely that Aristotelian metaphysics would be compatible with naturalism about finite objects. However,
such a strong naturalism will also be incompatible with both common sense and pretty much any serious ontological
theory other than nominalism.
