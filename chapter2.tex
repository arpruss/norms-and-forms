\section{Mersenne questions in ethics}
\subsection{Motivating examples}
\subsubsection{The rule of preferential treatment}
Let us begin with a more detailed discussion of an example from Thomas Aquinas's discussion of the order of charity. Aquinas thinks,
along with common sense, that those who are closer to us have a greater moral call on us.
Thus, if it is a question of bestowing the same good on one of two people, where one is more closely
related to us, we should benefit the closer one. But Aquinas writes: ``The case may occur, however, that one 
ought rather to invite strangers [to eat with us], on 
account of their greater want.''??ref And then he raises the question of what one should do ``if of two, one be 
more closely connected, and the other in greater want.''??ref

We might hope that here Aquinas would give us some clever rule for weighing connection against need. But 
instead he writes very sensibly: ``it is not possible to decide, by any general rule, which of them we ought 
to help rather than the other, since there are various degrees of want as well as of connection''.??ref It is
tempting at this point to throw up one's hands and simply say that in these in-between cases there is no
fact of the matter as to what should be done, or both options are permissible, or else relativism applies
to the case. But that would not do justice to the way we agonize when we find ourselves in such a difficult 
situation, trying to discover the truth of the matter. (It is interesting to note that the most common real-life moral dilemmas
tend to be like these kinds of cases, rather than highly controversial questions about trolleys, strategic bombing or
bioethics much discussed by philosophers.)
And indeed Aquinas maintains a realist attitude to
the question while simply offering this advice for how to figure out the answer in a particular case: ``the matter 
requires the judgment of a prudent man.??https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3031.htm\#article2

We can think of this as the problem of specifying a function $f(r,a,s,b)$ of four variables, two of them, $r$ and $s$, being
degrees of relation and the other two, $a$ and $b$, being degrees of benefit, where the function takes one of three values
corresponding to whether it is obligatory, permissible but not obligatory or impermissible to bestow a benefit of degree $a$ on a person with
relation of degree $r$ to the agent in place of bestowing a benefit of degree $b$ on someone related to degree $s$. 

In fact, the problem of a rule of preferential treatment is much more complicated than the above indicates. First, the \textit{kinds} of benefit and relation also matter: ``we ought in preference 
to bestow on each one such benefits as pertain to the matter in which, speaking simply, he is most closely connected with us.''??ref
So the function will depend not merely on quantitative features but qualitative ones. Second, although Aquinas does not mention it here,
the evaluation will no doubt depend on various features of the circumstances. And, third, in practice instead of choosing between
two certain benefits, we are choosing between two probability distributions over the space of possible benefits.

Now, as Aquinas admits, we do not know what the moral evaluation function for choices between benefits to different people is.
But abstractly speaking there is some such function, even if we do not know what it is, just as there is a function that assigns to each person
alive now the number of hairs they now have, even though we cannot specify any of the values of the function.
And we have good reason to expect the moral evaluation function to be very complicated. Indeed, probably the only serious proposal for a
relatively simple function $f$ here is the utilitarian suggestion that $f(r,a,s,b)$ yields obligation when $a>b$,
mere permission when $a=b$ and prohibition when $a<b$. But this utilitarian suggestion betrays the intuition that
the degrees of relation $r$ and $s$, much less the kinds of benefit and relation, are relevant to the moral evaluation.???refs

Indeed, the function is apt to look arbitrary. Fix the degrees of relationship to be one's parent and a total stranger,
and fix a specific and certain financial benefit of \$100 to one's parent, and fix the circumstances. Then as we vary the 
financial benefit to the stranger from zero to infinity, we will presumably initially have a requirement of benefiting the parent
(it would be wrong to give \$1 to a stranger instead of \$100 to a parent in ordinary circumstances), 
then a permission either way, and then a requirement to benefit the second party. There will be boundaries between these regions
of logical space, and these boundaries will look as arbitrary and contingent as the boundaries between different tax brackets.
Like the tax brackets, some proposals for boundaries will be \textit{clearly} unreasonable, but there will be many proposals
that appear reasonable. And whatever the actual boundaries will look arbitrary.

Of course, seemingly arbitrary numbers can come out of an elegant and simple rule: it seems arbitrary that the fifth and sixth 
digits of $\pi$ are $5$ and $9$ respectively, but there is an elegant mathematical explanation. But apart from the
utilitarian proposal, we do not have any at all plausible simple proposal for $f$.

These seemingly arbitrary boundaries in the order of charity raise call out for an explanation at least as much as 
the exact distance between the earth and the moon does. Just as it seems implausible that the distance between the earth
and the moon \textit{must} be exactly what it is, it seems implausible to think that the boundaries must be exactly where
they are---unless the utilitarian is right about $f$ being very simple. 

In fact, the ethics case calls out for an explanation even more than Mersenne's scientific examples did. For we might 
be able to swallow the earth-moon distance being a contingent and brute unexplained fact. But a brute fact seems unfitting for a moral
rule. A claim that it just so happened, with no explanation at all, that you should $\phi$ undercuts the moral force
of the alleged moral obligation. We expect anything seemingly arbitrary in our moral norms to have an explanatory ground.

To further argue for this point, consider a version of Divine Command Theory on which obligations are divine commands, and
God rolled indeterministic
dice to decide which actions to command, and by chance God's commands coincided with our common-sense morality, though they
could just as well as well have commanded cruelty and dishonesty. A Divine Command Theory on which it is mere chance
that cruelty is forbidden rather than commanded provides an unacceptable answer to the Euthyphro problem.??
Intuitively, a set of injunctions that is as arbitrary as that cannot constitute morality. But this point generalizes beyond
divine command theory. Suppose that that we have some preferential treatment rules that are brute and contingent, and could
just as well have enjoined on us the anti-utilitarian rule that we should always prefer the lesser benefit. Then whatever
these rules are, they do not constitute morality, but at best happen to agree with morality in content. 

Thus, even if there is some bruteness in the rules of preferential treatment, the rules in our world must be generated in a way
that makes rules such as the anti-utilitarian rules not be among the possible outcomes. But this makes it very unlikely that
the rules would be brute. For what force would limit the brute rules to avoid unacceptable options? Such a view of limited
bruteness would be akin to a view on which banana peels can come into existence \textit{ex nihilo}, but not where we might trip
over them.

It is important to remember that the Mersenne question here is a metaphysical question: What explanatory grounds are there for why this
rule, rather than some competitor, holds? The epistemic question may well have a virtue-theoretic answer like Aquinas's: if
we acquire the requisite virtues, we will be able to judge particular cases fairly reliably, and until then our best bet is
to ask the advice of virtuous others.

But before I continue the discussion of the possible explanation for the above ethical Mersenne question, let me follow
Mersenne's lead and multiply the examples, in order to defend against potential answers that only work in some cases, and
to make clear how widespread the problem is.

\subsubsection{Risk and uncertainty}
Some people---perhaps you---would accept a 92\% chance of winning a thousand dollars at the cost of an 8\% chance
of losing ten thousand. I wouldn't. I say that both I and they are reasonable. On the other hand, someone who 
(in ordinary circumstances) rejects a 99.9999\% chance of winning a thousand dollars at the cost of a 0.0001\% chance
of losing ten thousand and someone someone who accepts a 10\% chance of winning a thousand dollars at the cost of a 90\% chance
of losing ten thousand are unreasonable. 
It is well known that attitudes to risk vary between people, and while there are unreasonable attitudes, it is very plausible
that there is a broad range of reasonable attitudes.??refs
So, as we vary the probabilities of wins and losses, we move between cases
where accepting the risk is unreasonable, to cases where both accepting and rejecting are reasonable, to cases where
rejecting is unreasonable.

This, once again, raises the Mersenne problem of why the transitions between the various evaluative categories lie where they
do.  And of course things are more complicated than described above. The rational evaluation function will depend not just
on the probabilities involves but also on the values of the potential gains and losses. 

While in the previous case, utilitarianism provided a neat but implausible solution, so too in this case, expected utility
maximization provides a neat but implausible solution. On expected utility maximization, you are rationally required to
accept a chance $p$ of a good of degree $\alpha$ despite a chance $q$ of a bad of degree $\beta$ against a status quo of
value zero just in case the
expected utility $p\alpha + q\beta$ is strictly positive; when it is zero, you are permitted but not required; 
and when it is negative, you are not permitted. One problem with this solution is it requires all goods to be neatly
quantifiable (cf.\ the next example for difficulties related to that). But the more serious problem is that it requires an
implausibly negatively judgmental attitude towards ordinary people's attitudes to risk.

Indeed, here is a plausible trio of theses about risk that are incompatible with expected utility maximization:
\ditem{2-nobound}{There is no upper bound on possible finite utilities.}
\ditem{2-finite}{A decade of the worst tortures the KGB could think of has a finite negative utility.}
\ditem{2-notworthit}{There is no possible good $G$ of finite utility such that one would be rationally required in
accepting a certainty of a decade of the worst tortures the KGB could thing of one for a one in billion chance of $G$.}
For as long as $(1/1000000000)\alpha + \beta>0$, where $\alpha$ is the value of $G$ and $\beta$ is the (highly negative)
value of the tortures, one would rationally required to accept the deal on expected utility maximization, and by \dref{2-nobound}
and \dref{2-finite} there exists a possible $G$ that makes $(1/1000000000)\alpha + \beta$ strictly positive.
Hence, we should reject expected utility maximization, and and absent expected utility maximization, it is likely that the rationality evaluation function for risk will be messy
and arbitrary-looking.

The most plausible thing for the apologist for expected utility maximization to reject is the no-upper-bound thesis \dref{2-nobound}.
Here is one way an argument for such a rejection might go. First, there is a maximum intensity of goods that our brain can handle.
Second, goods become significantly less valuable as they are repeated, decreasing in such a way that the sum of the values of any 
goods you could have over an arbitrarily long life has an upper bound.??refs

But the repetition thesis is only plausible when boredom and other memory-based phenomena are in play. Suppose you have 
lived for a very long time. Then you suffer from partial amnesia: you have
lost all episodic memory of your past meals and of your past pinpricks. You are offered what you are reliably informed is 
the most delicious and wholesome dessert every prepared by the best chef on earth, a dessert  which you are told you've eaten some large 
number $n$ times in the past, and you may eat the dessert at the cost of a one in ten chance of a small pinprick. It's clearly worth it,
regardless of what $n$ is. So now suppose this happens to you every day of a very long life. The marginal value of each such 
dessert (i.e., the amount it contributes to total lifelong utility), absent memories of past desserts, must  be at least one 
tenth of the marginal disvalue of the pinprick, at least given expected  utility maximization. But the disvalue of the pinpricks 
clearly does not tend to zero with forgotten repetition. Hence, the value of the desserts does not tend to zero. And hence for any
finite utility bound, enough such desserts will exceed the bound.

In addition to Mersenne questions about risk and prudential rationality, there will be Mersenne questions about risk and morality.
For instance, what risks we may morally impose on others in exchange for a good to ourselves depends in a complex way 
on one's relationship to these others, the probability of the risk, the degree to which these others accept the risk, the 
benefit to self, and so on. When I drive, I risk killing other drivers, their passengers, pedestrians by the side road, and so on.
But the probability of these awful outcomes is very small, and typically other people on or by the road have accepted reasonable
risks (or have had them accepted by proxies, in the case of children), so these dire but unlikely outcomes typically do not render it impermissible for
me to go to the grocery store to pick up ice cream.\footnote{I leave open the question whether concerns about global warming 
render it impermissible.} But when the risk is higher, say because I am tired and sleepy after a long day and hence less likely to be
a safe driver, the matter becomes less clear. At some point, as the risk increases, it becomes impermissible to go to the grocery
store for ice cream. 
A particularly thorny set of issues arises in the special case of balancing the risk that the innocent are punished with the risk that the guilty go free.
And we have the Mersenne question of why the switchovers happen where they do.

Expected utility utilitarians\footnote{As opposed to actual-outcome utilitarians who evaluate actions morally based on the
actual utilities that would result from an action.??refs} will have a nice answer to this problem. But utilitarianism, as already
noted??ref, has many highly counterintuitive implications. 

\subsubsection{Orderings between goods}
Under ordinary circumstances, it would not be reasonable to choose to be a mediocre mathematician rather than a superb musician. 
But suppose one's choice is whether to be a superb
musician or a superb mathematician? Here we are dealing with incommensurable goods and either choice is reasonable.

But now let's ask this general question: Is it is reasonable to choose to be a mathematician of quality $\alpha$ rather than
a musician of quality $\beta$? Again, we have a function that takes a number of variables, including $\alpha$ and $\beta$
and the circumstances, and tells us whether (a)~it reasonable to opt to become a mathematician but not reasonable to opt for
music, or (b)~both are reasonable, or (c)~opting for music is reasonable but opting for mathematics is not. And, just as before,
it is very plausible that the function is extremely complex.

The problem obviously generalizes to all the many kinds of pairings of incommensurable goods there are.  In each case, there 
will be some function of many variables encoding the correct rational evaluation of the situation/, and we will have the Mersenne
question of what grounds the fact that this function, rather than one of the infinitely many others, encodes the correct
rational evaluation.

We also have Mersenne questions here that involve qualitative rather than quantitative comparisons. Other things being equal,
social pleasures are better than solitary ones. This seems rather arbitrary. What makes it be so?
 
In the preferential treatment and moral risk examples, utilitarianism offered a nice solution. But the problem of incommensurable goods is
also going to be a problem for any plausible utilitarianism. Utilitarianism comes in two varieties, depending on whether
the good is pleasure or the good is satisfaction of desire. As Mill famously noted, it is essential to the plausibility
of utilitarianism that one be able to make a distinction between lower and higher pleasures, so as to get the common-sense
conclusion that it is better to be Socrates unsatisfied than to be a satisfied pig.

But once one makes the distinction between lower and higher pleasures, or lower and higher desires, incommensurability
quickly shows up, since different kinds of pleasures and desires do not simply come in a linear ranking. Let's suppose that you get more 
enjoyment and satisfaction of the desire for truth out of mathematics and more enjoyment and satisfaction of the desire for music out of music, and let us suppose (contrary to typical situations)
that your choice of life will not affect anyone else. Then it seems right to say that the mathematical and musical lives are
incommensurable even on utilitarianism. But even if they are not incommensurable, but equal or one is better than the other, 
we still have a Mersenne problem as to what level of quality of mathematical life exceeds, equals or falls below what level of 
quality of musical life. And in fact it will be more complex than that, in that the quality of a mathematical or musical life
is clearly multidimensional.

One might try to get out of this by hoping for some precise definition of the degree of pleasure or the strength of a desire.
Perhaps there is a neural correlate of the degrees of pleasure or the strengths of desire that can be quantified in a single
number. But such an approach is likely to lead to the swinish utilitarianism that Mill wisely rejects. For presumably the
neural correlate can be manipulated directly, and the pig could be given pleasures which, in terms of neural intensity,
exceed the highest of Socrates' refined joys, and could be made to have a degree of intensity of desire for its swill far
exceeding Socrates' desire for virtue.  

Moreover, any neural approach is likely to fall prey to questions of cross-species comparison. While pig and human brains are
similar, they are not the same, and states of pleasure and desire are likely to be merely analogical. It is clear that some
comparisons between human and porcine goods are possible: a tiny human pleasure is worth less than a great porcine one. As one
increases the human pleasure and/or decreases the porcine one, there will come cases where neither of the two is to be
preferred, and then eventually cases where the human pleasure is to be preferred over the porcine one. But where exactly
the cross-over points are is not something we can just read off the neural correlates. And things get even messier when we
compare humans to possible beings that have no brains, such as intelligent robots (if these are possible) or aliens with very 
different biochemistry.

And even if one could give some such precise formulation, we would still have
the Mersenne problem of why \textit{this} formulation corresponds with true value rather than some other. 

\subsubsection{A miscellany of other Mersenne questions}
There are many other cases which involve thresholds or transitions that appear to be arbitrary.

On strict deontological views, one shouldn't torture one innocent person to save any number of lives. But of course
it would be permissible to gently prick someone with a pin to save even one life. Somewhere between the pinprick
and the torture is a transition. What makes the transition be where it is?

On threshold deontological views, it is wrong to torture one innocent to save a small number (say, one or two) of lives,
but it is permissible to do so to save a very large number (say, a billion). Again, we have a transition to be 
explained.\footnote{I am grateful to Philip Swenson for this example.} And note that even if one is a strict deontologist
about torturing the innocent, likely one is a threshold deontologist about some other things. Thus, one may think it's
permissible to save an innocent life but not permissible to lie to get a deserved (but on other grounds) salary raise,
and hence there needs to be an explanation of the grounds of the transition from permissibility to impermissibility. Or
one may think it is permissible to trespass on a neighbor's property to save a cat's life but not to save a grasshopper's.
Probably everyone who isn't a full-blown consequentialist is a threshold deontologist about some things.

The Principle of Double Effect allows one to foreseeably cause bad effects that it would
be impermissible to cause intentionally, as long as these bad effects are not intended either as ends or means. For instance, it seems permissible to bomb Hitler's headquarters even
if one finds out that an innocent prisoner is held captive there. But of course there needs to be a proportionality
condition imposed on this: the good achieved, say the end of a war, must be proportionate to the bad, say the death of the prisoner. 
It would be wrong to demolish an old building while knowing that there is a child playing inside: the good of having a lot to build
on is not proportionate to the death of the child. So there will be some function of variables including harms and benefits that
specifies when the benefit is proportional to the harm in Double Effect contexts. In fact, there will be other variables, such as
one's relationships to those harmed and those benefited. 

The laws of a legitimate government should generally be obeyed. But when a government becomes sufficiently unconcerned
about the wellbeing of the people, it becomes illegitimate. Why does this transition happen where it does?

Punishment should not be disproportionate to a crime. But in a legal system without a strict \textit{lex talionis}, the
proportionality is not going to follow any simple and elegant rule. Nonetheless, there are obvious restrictions. 
A month's imprisonment for an ordinary parking infraction is disproportionate in one direction; a ten dollar fine
for a murder is disproportionate in the other. What grounds the specific rule of proportionality?

Finally, standards of consent necessary to permit one's being treated a certain way vary widely depending on the treatment.
There are multiple dimensions in which we can measure the ``strength'' of a consent requirement: how well informed the 
consenting party needs to be, what age or level of intellectual development does the party need to have, what proxies if
any can offer consent on the party's behalf, how unpressured the consent needs to be, how clearly formulate the consent
needs to be, whether the consent must be specific to the case or whether prior blanket consent suffices, etc.
Under ordinary circumstances, no consent---at most, lack of refusal---is needed for a pat on the shoulder. The permissibility
of major surgery, however, has a consent requirement of significant ``strength'' along many of the above axes. On the other hand,
the permissibility of sex has a consent requiremnt of even greater ``strength'' along some of the above axes---thus, while
proxy consent and prior blanket consent can suffice for major surgery, they do not suffice for sex.\footnote{It is tempting
to explain this in terms of the fact that surgery---or at least the sort of surgery for which proxy consent suffices---benefits 
the patient regardless of the patient's consent, while sex is only beneficial when consented to. But this is arguably false.
Parents can validly consent to an organ transplant between their children, even if the donor is not expected to benefit
on balance (though generally there is a benefit from having one's sibling alive!).} The mapping between
the form of treatment and the multidimensional strength of consent is of great complexity, and has an appearance of significant
arbitrariness. What grounds it?

Some readers will disagree with a number of the examples. Double Effect, for instance, is quite controversial. But it seems
likely that a number of the remaining examples will still compellingly raise Mersenne problems. And the list above is not
exhaustive: the reader should be able to generate more items.

\subsection{Arbitrariness}
Whatever the values of the parameters in the ethical Mersenne questions are, these values appear likely to be such 
that if we knew their exact values, we would find them arbitrary.
In physics, some hold out a hope that the fundamental constants in the fundamental laws of nature may be ``nice numbers'' like
$2$, $\pi$, $\sqrt 2$ or $e$. It seems intuitively even less plausible that things would so turn out in ethics. 

And even if the parameters turned out to be such ``nice numbers'', that would itself be a very surprising fact, because while
such numbers seem very natural in physics, they seem rather less natural in ethics. Imagine that you should benefit your 
parent over a sibling just in case the ratio of benefits is no lower than $1:\sqrt{2}$. That would itself seem arbitrary.
It seems that whatever the numbers turn out to be, they will have an appearance of arbitrariness and of contingency.

\subsection{The human nature solution}
On our Aristotelian picture, the nature of an organism grounds norms about what the organism's structure and behavior 
should be. In particular, the nature of the organism will ground many arbitrary-seeming norms, such as those governing
the range of appropriate sizes of Indian elephants, the migratory behaviors of monarch butterflies, and the lengths of 
human femurs. Having the nature makes the organism be the kind of organism it is, and imposes on it the associated norms.

In the case of humans, the behaviors include voluntary ones, and so it is unsurprising that there are norms governing these
as well. And just as there are many parameters governing bodily structure and sub-voluntary behavior, there are many parameters
governing moral behavior, all grounded in the form. 

At the same time, Aristotelian optimism provides us with evidence as to what the parameters approximately are. The actual
bodily structures of humans give defeasible evidence as to what normative human bodily structure is and the actual behaviors
of humans give defeasible evidence of moral norms. And in both cases, we have ways of identifying healthier or more virtuous 
paradigms, using the optimistic idea??backref that the various ways of doing well tend to hang together with some
degree of unity, and the structure and behavior of such paradigms gives us further evidence as to the norms.

Admittedly, there appears to be a disanalogy between health and virtue. We might use a Mahatma Ghandi or a Mother Teresa to 
figure out moral norms, but we wouldn't use an Usain Bolt or a Serena Williams to figure out physical norms. One explanation 
of the difference is that Bolt and Williams have highly-developed traits that are specialized to a forms of life quite
different from that of the typical human---namely, the life of a professional athlete---while Ghandi and Teresa's excellences
in justice, fortitude and mercy are as important to our life as to theirs.

All this raises the question of why the form includes these norms and not others. Here there is an easy 
answer available. The form is at least partly defined by the norms it includes. Thus, Mersenne's question about the lion and
the ant when reformulated into normative terms, as the question of why the lion's strength \textit{ought to} be greater
than the ant's, is easily answered: this follows fron defining features of what make lions be lions and ants be ants. 

The appearance of arbitrariness and of contingency in the ethical Mersenne problems is somewhat misleading: it is like the appearance of arbitrariness and
contingency in the fact that water is H$_2$O or that carbon atoms have six protons. Water couldn't have a different chemical
structure and carbon atoms couldn't have a different number of protons. But it is also an important truth  here that there 
could be other substances that could have a different chemical structure or a different number of protons. Similarly, \textit{we}
couldn't have other norms of preferential treatment than the ones written on our nature, but there could be---and perhaps in
this vast universe are---other intelligent animals with other such norms.

\subsection{Other solutions}
We thus have many Mersenne questions pointing to arbitrary-seeming parameters in ethical rules.
I will now argue that a broad spectrum of ethical theories and solultions are unlikely to yield good answers to the Mersenne questions
or else raise new Mersenne questions of their own.

\subsubsection{Kantianism}
Kantianism is an attempt to derive moral rules from the very concept of objective rationality. Famously, this leads to difficulties in
accounting for the substantive content of rules. For instance, from the point of view of objective rationality, it is difficult
to generate a presumption in favor of causing pleasure and against causing pain. The more tightly connected a moral rule is to the
specifics of the human condition and of the circumstances, the more difficult it will be for the Kantian to account for it. But the Mersenne questions above
thrive precisely on such detail. Consider, for instance, the improbability of a good Kantian account of how much we 
should, other things being equal, favor siblings over cousins, or of why proxy consent is sufficient for surgery but insufficient for
sex. The ``logical distance'' between the high level principles, like the categorical imperative to treat others as ends and never
as mere means or to act according to universalizable rules, and such specific moral content appears unlikely to be bridgeable.
Thus, precisely those cases that we have seen to raise compelling Mersenne problems make Kantianism an implausible ethical theory.

Of course, such appearances can be deceiving. One might well have antecedently thought that the relatively simple axioms of set 
theory are unlikely to generate the richness of mathematical theorems that we have seen to come from them. So it would be good
to go beyond an intuition of ``distance''.

There are at least four ways to do that. First, proceed by intuitions regarding a specific example. Consider two different moral rules regarding to the relative treatment
of siblings and cousins. One rule says that benefits to siblings are to be slightly preferred to benefits to first cousins and the
second says that first cousins and siblings are to be treated on par. Neither rule requires us to treat anyone as a mere means or 
takes away from treating people as ends. Both rules are universalizable. So we are not going to be able to derive one rule rather
than the other from Kantianism as originally formulated by Kant. 

Second, we can makes use of a heuristic as to the validity of arguments. One heuristic I employ in checking whether a numbered argument 
given by undergraduate students is valid, i.e., whether its conclusion logically follows from its premises, is to see if the conclusion of the
argument contains any substantive terms that do not appear in any of the premises. If it does, it is in practice unlikely that the 
argument is valid, though of course there are possible exceptions. If the premises are contradictory, then the logical
rule of explosion makes every conclusion a valid consequence. And it could also be that the conclusion is disjunctive and the
substantive term that did not occur in the premises occurs in one disjunct while another disjunct follows from the premises (though 
I have yet to see this happen in a student paper).  An argument from premises about the nature of rationality as such
with a conclusion about specific familial relationships or about specific human activities such as sex or surgery fails the heuristic,
and hence is unlikely to be valid. And the cases do not seem to be like the most common exceptions---the premises are not contradictory
and the conclusion is not disjunctive.

Third, all or most of the examples that raised Mersenne questions have an appearance of contingency to them, in a way that does not
fit with the hypothesis that they derive from necessary principles about the nature of rationality. One way to formulate this
contingency is to note that many of the rules are ones that we would not expect to apply to other intelligent species. If we
came across an alien species that regarded familial ties as somewhat more or somewhat less important than we think permissible
for humans, we should not judge them immoral. It would not surprise us if other intelligent animals---perhaps ones occupying
other niches---were rationally or morally required to take greater or smaller risks than we.\footnote{One thinks, for instance,
of the Klingons and Kelpians from the Star Trek universe, respectively.}

Finally, we have an epistemological argument. While clearly we do not know the exact values of the parameters in the Mersenne
questions, we have some approximate knowledge, as already indicated above in a number of the cases. We clearly did not come
to this approximate knowledge by logically deriving it from Kantian first principles. Nor did we even do so by means of an
intuition that they follow from these principles. For I take it that we do not in fact have an intuition that, say, the
preference for siblings over cousins follows from Kantian principles. If anything, we have an intuition that it does not.
So, it seems that if these rules in fact follow from Kantian principles, it's just a coincidence that our beliefs about
the parameters are correct, a coincidence that makes the beliefs be mere justified true belief rather than
knowledge. But the beliefs are knowledge. So, the Kantian explanation does not work. 

The epistemological argument has some force, but not that much. First, the argument is related to the highly controverted
literature on evolutionary debunking arguments.??refs,add?? Second, a theistic reader has an easy way out of the argument:
God knows what values of parameters in fact logically follow from Kantian principles and could either directly instil in
us correct beliefs about them or ensure that we evolve in a way that yields such true beliefs.

\subsubsection{Act utilitarianism}
The main problem with act utilitarianism is that it generates incorrect moral claims. It says that a healthy patient
whose organs can save three others can be killed when doing so doesn't have any other countervailing consequences such
as making others more callous. It says that if you and I are loners who make no contribution to society, but I own
a dog and you don't have any pets, then you have a duty to sacrifice your life for mine, to save my dog from being
ownerless; and if neither of us has a pet, but you enjoy chocolate a little more than I do while everything else is
equal, then I have a duty to sacrifice my life for you, since your life would include slightly more utility.

Moreover, as we saw in ??back, for utilitarianism to be plausible and not swinish requires a hierarchy of goods,
and there will be Mersenne questions regarding that.

Finally, even hard-nosed desire-fulfillment or hedonistic utilitarianism will be unlikely to be exempt from Mersenne
questions. There are multiple mental state concepts that could be argued to correspond to the words ``desire'' and 
``pleasure''. 

When the psychotherapist tells Jones that she always unconsciously wanted to kill her mother, is that a ``desire''
in the sense of desire-fulfillment utilitarianism or not? A case can be made either way, and this decision point generates
a degree of freedom for the theory, and hence a Mersenne question as to why it is one sort of ``desire'' or the other that counts
as defining the good. In fact, reflection the complexity of human life as seen in literature??ref:ColinAllen? shows that there are likely
to be many ``desire''-type concepts, differing along multiple dimensions, and hence generating a multiplicity of Mersenne question.
And there will be multiple ways of quantifying the strength of a desire.

And as for pleasure and pain, we will again have a broad variety of concepts and a multiplicity of ways of quantifying them.
This can perhaps best be seen if we think about the mental life of possible and actual non-human sentients. Does a particular
state of an earthworm count as a pleasure? It is unlikely to be exactly like a state of ours. There will likely be many ways
of classifying mental states across species, and on some the worm's state will be a pleasure and on others it won't. So we have
a degree of freedom in our act utilitarianism as to what we count as pleasure or pain in non-humans. And even within humans 
there are complex questions. Consider for instance masochism or the subtle morose ``satisfaction'' of the pessimist who sees 
everything going downhill. There are likely to be different ways of classifying states as pleasures or pains, and the hedonistic
utilitarian will have a Mersenne question as to why one rather than another classification is the one that defines ethics.

\subsubsection{Rule utilitarianism}
On rule utilitarianism, instead of requiring that each action optimize total utility, it is required that each action
follow rules that are themselves optimized for total utility. Rule utilitarianism's main advantage is held to be that
its escape from the counterintuitive consequences of act utilitarianism. The rule not to kill the innocent may well be the
optimal rule for us, even if in a lifeboat situation it would maximize utility for the two stronger people to kill
and eat the weaker third.

Rule utilitarianism could not only neatly explain the
apparently arbitrary specifics of the moral rules, but could also explain the appearance of arbitrariness and contingency
in a way that, say, Kantianism is unlikely to. For the optimization procedure that would define the moral rules would be a vast
and complex one, taking into account the impact of the actions falling under the rules both in the short and the long run, 
both on humans and on non-humans. It is unsurprising if a complex optimization procedure produces results that seem
arbitrary but are in fact carefully chosen to their end. A computer-optimized airplane wing will have precise angles and
bends that cannot really be explained without running through the whole computation.

Moreover, rule utilitarianism is less prone than Kantianism to make our limited but true beliefs about the moral rules be 
merely coincidental. For we have evolved biologically and mimetically in the service of survival and reproduction, and 
because of the contingent connections between these goods and other aspects of utility, evolution put pressures on us 
that directed our moral beliefs in a truthful direction. There are deep and difficult questions whether this is enough
to make the connection between our beliefs and the truth be sufficient for knowledge??refs, but there is more hope here
than on the Kantian side.

However, famously, rule utilitarianism divides into two varieties, depending on exactly what the rules are optimized for.
On ideal rule utilitarianism, the rules are such that everyone's successfully following them would be optimal, even if in
fact they are too difficult for us to follow. Ideal rule utilitarianism, however, is widely held to reduce to act
utilitarianism, since if everyone were to actually follow the rule of maximizing utility, that would be optimal
with respect to maximizing utility. But act utilitarianism has already been put aside.??backref

Non-ideal rule utilitarianisms, on the other hand, inject a note of realism into the optimization procedures. For instance,
what might render a set of rules correct is that if everyone were to \textit{try} to follow them, optimal results would
result. This already raises a Mersenne question. For trying is something that comes in degrees, and it is very likely that
different rules will be generated when we optimize for the utility resulting from everyone's trying hard to follow them
than if if we optimize for the utility resulting from everyone's trying with minimal effort. And there will be a vast
number of intermediate cases, so there will be a Mersenne question of what grounds the fact that $\alpha$, say, is
the right degree of effort for defining the optimization procedure that generates the moral rules.

Furthermore, specifying the degree to which the hypothetical agents try to follow the moral rules is not enough to specify the
optimization procedure. For instance, one has to specify the level of intelligence of the hypothetical agents, their non-moral 
interests and the environment, which yields multiple Mersenne questions as to what the requisite levels of these for the 
hypothetical optimization procedure are. 

The only way to avoid such questions is to  simply require the counterfactual world to match our
world in the respects, but this runs into two problems.
First, we would normally expect a world where all agents try to follow the moral rules to have agents that have different non-moral
interests, higher levels of intelligence since such a world would have a much more just educational system
than ours and hence would nurture children into greater intelligence, and a rather different natural environment. If we try
to keep the three factors fixed while having the hypothetical agents try to follow the moral rules, we are likely to get
some very unlikely counterfactual results, just as keeping too much of our world fixed in a counterfactual situation
results in the odd claim that if Oswald did not kill Kennedy, Kennedy would have been buried alive. 
Second, we have to say that if our history had gone slightly differently, so that (say) the distribution of intelligence in the
general population were slightly different, the optimization procedure would have generated different rules, and hence different
moral rules would have been true. Indeed, on this view we would get the very strange idea that what we morally do can affect morality
itself.

Besides this, there are other non-ideal aspects that we should probably introduce. Some of our important moral rules discuss how
we should deal with culpable malefactors. But in a world where everyone tries to do the right thing, depending on the strength
of trying, there might well be \textit{no} culpable malefactors, or at least very few. And it is unlikely that moral rules optimized
for such a very different situation would be likely to be the right ones for us. So we probably need to optimize the rules with
respect to a hypothetical situation where not everyone tries to follow them. And that raises Mersenne questions as to how many
people in the hypothetical case follow these rules, and what the others do with their lives. 

In short, ideal rule utilitarianism is implausible, while developing the non-ideal rule utilitarian project raises multiple
Mersenne questions as to the details of what is to be fixed in the hypothetical situation.

\subsubsection{Social contract}
Contemporary social contract theories are based on duties grounded in hypothetical agreement between agents in situations of 
ignorance.??refs Anyone who has been in a long committee meeting knows that actual agreement between agents can result in 
complex rules with much apparent arbitrariness, and it would be unsurprising if hypothetical agreement were similar. Thus far, 
social contract fits our data well. 

But the hypothetical agreement condition involves multiple parameters such as how smart the hypothetical agreers are (and there are
multiple dimensions of intelligence), what exactly are they ignorant of, how many of them are there, what are their attitudes towards
risk and uncertainty, etc. We have here an explanation of the Mersenne parameters in terms of other Mersenne parameters, and the
problem remains fully entrenched. 

\subsubsection{Virtue ethics}
Aquinas himself invoked the virtuous agent as providing at least the epistemic path to an answer to the preferential treatment
question. We could also take virtue ethics to provide an answer to the Mersenne question: What makes these parameters, rather
than others, hold is that the virtuous agent's patterns of behavior are thus and so parameterized.

But this of course simply shifts the problem to that of why the virtuous agent's patterns of behavior are parameterized as
they are. The best answer to that question appears to be the one given in the Aristotelian tradition which grounds this in
the agent's nature.

\subsubsection{Divine command}
On divine command ethics, the right is what is commanded by God.
Divine command ethics, like social contract and rule utilitarianism, carries with it significant hope for explaining the apparent
arbitrariness in ethical parameters. We would not be surprised if the laws coming from an infinitely intelligent and good legislator 
had significant complexity that to us would look like arbitrariness. 

It may initially seem the divine command ethics runs into the same problem of pushing the Mersenne questions back to the
question of why God legislated these parameters and not others. But notice that the Mersenne problems I have been discussing
are \textit{grounding} questions. Even if God's legislation were completely arbitrary in a way that ultimately violated the
Principle of Sufficient Reason, on divine command ethics we would have a \textit{ground} for the parameters in preferential
treatment and other ethical rules being what they are. To say that we should prefer siblings over first cousins in a ratio
of $1.7:1$ because God commanded so is to give a ground for the obligation, even if that ground itself needs an explanation.
Compare the moral prohibition on adding cyanide to friends' drinks. There would be something absurd if that prohibition were
ungrounded. But it has a ground, or at least a partial ground: cyanide is fatal to humans. Imagine now that there was in fact 
no possible explanation of why cyanide is fatal to humans. Nonetheless, the grounding problem for the moral prohibition would
have been solved by citing the danger of cyanide.

In this way, our ethical grounding Mersenne problem is quite different from Mersenne's merely explanatory problem. In Mersenne's case
to explain why the distance between the earth and the moon is what it is in terms of other parameters of earlier states of the
solar system does not make significant progress. But when we have given a plausible ground to the moral obligation, we have
indeed made progress. Mersenne's original argument depends for its plausibility on a fairly general Principle of Sufficient
Reason.??ref-on-PSRr Here we just use a heuristic principle that moral truths with
an appearance of arbitrariness need a deeper ground.

Moreover, the divine command theorist has nice answers available to the question of why God chose these rules. For instance,
God could be an act consequentialist and could have optimized the rules to produce the best consequences, including perhaps
such consequences as the value of following and disvalue of breaking moral rules in addition to first order values and 
disvalues like pleasure and pain.  We would expect a complex optimization to produce results with an appearance of arbitrariness.
A sailboat hull computer-optimized to minimize drag is likely to have many parameters that look arbitrary to those who do not
know how it was generated.

At the same time, we still have some serious Mersenne grounding problems. The plausibility of divine command ethics rests in
the idea that God is a legitimate authority and legitimate authorities need to be obeyed. This suggests that logically prior
to divine command ethics there is some sort of a proto-ethical general rule about obedience to legitimate authority. That 
rule itself will have to have parameters specifying which authorities are legitimate and what the scope of their authority is. 
And we will have the Mersenne problem of grounding these parameters.

Moreover, even if we do not have such a general rule about all authority, but a specific rule about divine authority, this
will still raise some Mersenne problems. For, as Aquinas noted??ref, legislation only has a claim on our obedience when it 
is appropriately promulgated. And promulgation is a complex concept involving thresholds and parameters. It is not necessary
for promulgation that all those subject to the legislation have heard of it. But it is not enough for the legislators to
meet secretly, and write the legislation on a stone  buried on public land. Intuitively, we need the legislation to be 
reasonably accessible to those governed by it, but there are many parameters hidden behind the word ``reasonably'', and 
we need grounds for them all.

Nor is it even the case that the promulgation condition on God's commands is met in a really clear way, so that all that
would suffice is some proto-rule that has a really strict and non-arbitrary promulgation condition like that everyone 
governed knows of the rules. For any such strict condition is likely to have in fact been violated by God's commands, since
there is no agreement on what God's commands are---or even on there being a God.

What is worse, when we focus on the Mersenne cases in ethics, it unclear that divine commands instituting the parameters
would even satisfy a fairly modest promulgation that requires those who try really hard to be able to find what the legislation 
is when it is relevant to life. There surely are cases where we have tried really hard to figure out what is the right thing
to do and we didn't succeed. Perhaps it could be argued that we didn't try ``hard enough'', but now we are the true
Scotsman territory.??more?

\subsection{Particularism}
One might try to escape the Mersenne questions by opting for particularism. On particularism, while there may be general rules
like ``Other things being equal, don't torture people'', the application of these general rules to specific situations is not
rule-governed. Hence, there won't be a rule specifying when one, say, favors a sibling over a cousin. Instead, there are 
particular facts about what to do in particular situations. 

However, particularism only multiplies the Mersenne questions. For whereas on rule-based systems we had Mersenne questions
about why the parameters in the rules had the values they do, now we will have Mersenne questions about why in particular actual
circumstances $C_1$ we should act one way while in slightly different particular actual circumstances $C_2$ we should act a
different way.

Furthermore, plausibly, there will still abstractly speaking be a function that assigns to each circumstances a hypothetical determination
of how one would be obligated to act in that circumstance. There may, of course, be no formula specifying the function, but that does not
affect the Mersenne question of why this function rather than another, perhaps similar one, is correct.

\subsubsection{A two-step vagueness strategy}
It is very tempting to dismiss the Mersenne questions above with a two-step strategy. In each case, we first give non-arbitrary grounds for 
an approximate and vague determination of the parameters involved. Thus, while it is implausible to think that, say, social contract theory
will generate a precise answer to the preferential treatment question, it is reasonable to think it will generate claims like: ``Benefits to 
siblings are to be \textit{somewhat} preferred to benefits to cousins.'' And, then, we simply note that the Mersenne question as to the grounds
of the exact dividing line has the false presupposition that there is an exact dividing line---instead, we have insuperable vagueness.
This is probably the best alternative to the form-based approach I am defending.

A first concern with the two-step strategy is to worry whether other ethical theories can actually generate sufficient non-arbitrary grounds
that have the degree of precision that we think really is there. 
This concern has two variants. One involves cases where we know what the facts generating the Mersenne questions are.
Kantianism, for instance, is unlikely to generate even a vague morally-relevant 
distinction favoring siblings over cousins, and yet we know there is such a distinction. The problem of ranking types of goods generates difficult 
Mersenne questions as to what grounds comparisons that we know are there, such as that fundamental philosophical truths are more valuable than the 
pleasures of chocolate. The second variant of the concern involves cases where we agonize over what to do. Our agonizing is a sign of our intuition
that there is an answer to a moral problem, albeit one we cannot discern. While we may not be seeking for absolute precision, and may be willing
to accept some level of vagueness, in a number of cases we seek for more precision than the various alternatives to the form-based theory can ground. 

A more radical problem with the two-step strategy is a general problem for non-epistemic views of vagueness: the problem of the apparent violation
of logical principles.??ref:Sorensen Fix circumstances $C$ and observe that:
\begin{itemize}
\item[($A_0$)] Giving $ \$100$ to a stranger is better than giving $ \$1$ to one's parent.
\end{itemize}

Now for each positive integer $n$, consider the statement:
\begin{itemize}
\item[($A_n$)] Giving $ \$100$ to a stranger is not better than giving $ \$n$ to one's parent, or giving  $ \$100$ to a stranger is better than giving
    $ \$(n+1)$ to one's parent.
\end{itemize}

From $A_0$ and $A_1$, one concludes by the disjunctive syllogism that giving $ \$100$ to a stranger is better than giving $ \$2$ to one's parent.
From this and $A_2$, by the disjunctive syllogism one concludes that this is true even if what one gives one's parent is $ \$3$. Continuing onward,
once we get to $A_{199}$, we conclude that it's better to give $ \$100$ to a stranger than $ \$200$ to one's parent, which is false. The argument
is valid: the conclusion follows from the premises by repeated use of the disjunctive syllogism. When we have a valid argument for a false 
conclusion, one or more of the premises has to be true. Since $A_0$ is true, it must be that $A_n$ is false for some $n>0$. Thus, by De~Morgan,
there is an $n$ such that:
\ditem{2-trans}{Giving $ \$100$ to a stranger is better than giving $ \$n$ to one's parent and giving $ \$100$ to a stranger is not better than giving
    $ \$(n+1)$ to one's parent.}
In other words, classical logic guarantees that there is a transition point between where it's better to give to the stranger and where it's not better to give the stranger.

\subsubsection{Anti-realism}
Retreating from realism in ethics to error theory does, of course, remove all the Mersenne problems in ethics. But the
cost is high: it is incorrect to say that genocide is wrong. Moreover, since some of the Mersenne problems involve not
just morality but also prudential reasoning, this requires one to deny the correctness of standard prudential reasoning.
But perhaps the most serious problem with the error theoretic solution is that we will have parallel Mersenne problems
in other normative areas, such as epistemology (??forward) and semantics (??forward), and the cost of error theory 
there is very high indeed: indeed one will no longer  be able to correctly say that one \textit{ought to} accept error theory.

A more moderate solution is to opt for a form of ethical relativism. Relativism, of course, suffers from serious and
standard objections.??refs Perhaps the most obvious is that it justifies an ultra-conservative approach: for if what
I (in the case of individual relativism) or my society (in the social variant) thinks is guaranteed to be true, then
I or society has no reason to take variant views into account, since if you disagree with me or my society, you're guaranteed to be 
wrong (from my or my society's point of view).

Moreover, relativism is itself prone to
Mersenne question. Consider individual relativism first on which a moral claim is true just in case one believes
it. The Mersenne question here will be most obvious if one opts for a view on which belief reduces to having a
credence above some probabilistic threshold, say $0.95$. For then the relativist view comes down to the thesis
that a moral claim is true just in case one assigns it a credence of at least $0.95$. But that seems arbitrary.
Why should one be obligated to do what one has credence of $0.95$ in, but not obligated what one has credence of $0.93$ in?
So we have a threshold problem.

Many, however, resist the reduction of belief to a credential threshold. But if we do not so reduce belief, we should
then see belief as just one positive doxastic state among many such as surmising, being inclined to think, believing,
being confident that, and being sure that. Moreover, a little reflection shows that
such classifications are too coarse grained to do justice to the richness of our mental life. So we have a Mersenne
question: Why are more claims made true by my believing them rather than my surmising them or being sure of them?

And thinking that the problem here just involves degrees of confidence is probably neglecting much complexity in the human
mind. There is likely a continuum between fully believing and merely acting as if one believes. Why does moral truth show up
in the continuum where it does? Or think of the case when the psychotherapist diagnoses one with a subconscious belief.
Either such define moral truths or they do not, and whichever it is, we have a Mersenne question as to why. And consciousness
itself may come in degree.

Furthermore, a narrow relativism that just makes those moral claims that we actually believe is very implausible. Suppose I believe that it is wrong
to eat animals, and I know that cows are animals, but I do not actually draw the conclusion that it is wrong to eat cows.
On such a narrow relativism, it would be wrong for me to eat animals but it would not be wrong for me to eat cows, even though
I know them to be animals. This is incredible. So we want to extend moral truth at least to things that clearly follow from my moral beliefs.
But probably we do not want to extend it to things that follow in ways that are far beyond our ability to know. For, first,
if do extend it thus far, then a Kantian might end up counting as a relativist, since the Kantian may think that moral truths are
necessary truths, and that necessary truths follows follow from everything. And, second, it seems that this loses sight of the 
internalist motivations of relativism. But if we restrict moral truth to things that follow \textit{sufficiently easily} from
our beliefs. And we will have a Mersenne question of grounding where the line of sufficient easiness lie.

If our relativism is of the social sort, we will have analogues to the above Mersenne questions raised by belief and consequence.  And we 
will have more Mersenne questions There is a complex and difficult literature on how to attribute doxastic states to a community. A reasonable
reading of that literature is that there is a multiplicity of concepts that can be expressed with a phrase like ``The committee believes 
that $p$.'' For instance, belief by the vast majority of the committee members is enough on the more reductive concepts, 
while on more procedural versions of the concepts the committee's belief requires some sort of a joint procedure, such as a vote. 
There will be many answers here, corresponding to a broad spectrum of takes on what a community's beliefs is. And a social relativist
will then have a Mersenne question as to why moral truth is defined by the particular take in question.

The second set of Mersenne question arises from the question of identifying what counts as one's community. I am a citizen of two countries
and a permanent resident of a third. Are the moral beliefs of all of these communities---no doubt, mutually contradictory in various ways---true
for me, or only of one? Do moral beliefs come to be true as applied to me because I am legally a member of the community, or because I identify
with it emotionally, or because I would like to identify with it emotionally? Or is it, perhaps, that every community's beliefs are true
for the community, but there is no such thing as being true for the members of the community? (That would nicely solve the problem of
contradictions between the various communities I am a part of.) How large does a community have to be to define moral truths? Is a chess
club a commmunity that defines moral truths? What if the chess club goes down to one member? Are a pair of friends a community? It is clear
that there are many degrees of freedom in a social relativistic theory, and we would have a Mersenne question corresponding to each of them.

\section{Metaethics}
\section{Flourishing}
\section{Supererogation}
\section{A great chain of being}
Here is an intuition that until fairly recently would have been widely shared: There are deep metaphysical divides between non-living and living things, 
and between merely living things and persons, and these divides mark a hierarchy of value, a chain of being. If we could defend such a divide, it would 
dovetail with the idea that persons are in an important way \textit{sacred}, having rights while other things have mere interests, if that. 

I want to offer a highly speculative Aristotelian reconstruction of this intuition. To introduce the reconstruction, start with a puzzle for
Aristotelian views. It seems that on such views:
\ditem{2-pursue-perfect}{Each thing naturally strives for its own perfections.}
\ditem{2-natural-activity}{The natural activity of a thing is a perfection of it.}
But this generates a regress. Let's say that reproduction is an oak tree's perfection. Then by \dref{2-pursue-perfect}, the oak tree naturally strives for 
reproduction. This natural activity of striving for reproduction, by \dref{2-natural-activity}, is then itself a perfection of the oak tree. Therefore,
by \dref{2-pursue-perfect}, the oak tree must naturally strive for it: hence the oak tree naturally strives for striving for reproduction. And so on,
\textit{ad infinitum}. But surely an oak tree does not pursue infinitely many things. And even after a few level of meta-striving we exhaust plausibility.

I suggest that we can deny \dref{2-pursue-perfect}. Some perfections of a thing are not actually naturally striven for by the thing.\footnote{An interesting
theological example may be the idea in the Thomistic tradition that both the beatific vision and our striving for it are gifts of God's grace, rather than
natural for us, even though the beatific vision perfects us.??} The oak tree does strive for reproduction with its reproductive organs. Moreover, it has a 
second order striving: it strives to strive for reproduction, by growing the reproductive organs with which it strives for reproduction. There may be one or
two more meta-levels, but at some point we can say: it just does this, without striving to do it.

Non-living things, on an Aristotelian metaphysics, also have form and also strive for ends. ???
