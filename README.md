# forms
This repository contains in-progress drafts of _Forms and Norms_ by Alexander Pruss. You are permitted to look at and download the material for your own personal and scholarly use, and I very much welcome comments (just click on "Issues" and submit a bug report!) but you are not permitted to distribute it further. If you must quote from the manuscript, explicitly say that you are quoting from "an in-progress early draft".

This repository will likely disappear as soon as the book draft is submitted to a publisher, and perhaps sooner.
