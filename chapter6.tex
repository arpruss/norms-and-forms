\subsection{Aquinas' Fourth Way and the good}
Aquinas' Fourth Way??ref puzzles the modern reader. It begins with a principle that comparisons between
degreed properties are grounded in a comparison to a maximal case: one is more $F$ when one is more like
the item that is maximally $F$. Aquinas then illustrates the principle with the case of heat and fire:
an object is hotter provided that it is more akin to the hottest thing, namely fire. He then applies
the principle to goodness, and concludes that there is a best thing, and this is God.

The fire illustration is not just unhelpful to us, since we know that fire is not the hottest thing (the sun is almost
twice as hot as the hottest flame), but it is actually a conclusive counterexample to the degree property principle,
since we can easily compare temperatures without reference to an alleged hottest object.\footnote{In any finite universe,
presumably there will be a hottest object. However, temperature comparison is not defined by that object, since 
even if Bob is in fact the hottest object, we would expect it to be physically possible to have a hotter object 
than Bob. But if degrees of heat were defined by closeness to Bob, it would not be possible to be hotter than
Bob, since nothing can be closer to Bob than Bob.}

So Aquinas' comparison principle is false. But I contend that there is still something to his argument
when applied to the good. 

Now, a form-based metaphysics gives a powerful account of the good for a being of
a particular kind---an oak, a sheep or a human, say---in terms of its match to the specifications of the
form. It also gives a ground to comparisons between the good of different instances of the same kind:
a four-legged sheep is, other things equal, better at sheepness than a three-legged sheep, because it
more completely fulfills the specification in their ovine nature. In fact, this is itself a counterexample 
to Aquinas' comparison principle, in that we can compare degrees of success at sheepness without supposing
any individual sheep to be perfect.

However, in addition to value comparisons within a kind, there are ones between kinds. When Jesus says
that we are ``worth more than many sparrows'' (Mt.\ 10:31??ref), what he says is quite uncontroversial.
Indeed, even a perfect sparrow seems to have less good than a typical human. While the nature of a sparrow
will enable value comparisons between sparrows, and that of a human between humans, we still have the question
of what grounds the value the difference between sparrows and humans. Some Aristotelians reject cross-kind 
value comparisons as nonsense.??refs But given the intuitive plausibility of many such comparisons, this rejection
is a costly one.

Aquinas' Fourth Way is not infrequently seen as more Platonic than his other arguments for the existence of
God, and Plato indeed had a solution to the problem of cross-kind comparisons, by talking of differing degrees
of imitation of the Form of the Good, which itself is perectly good. Plato, on the other hand, lacked a 
satisfactory solution to the problem of intra-kind comparisons. He may well have thought that there 
was a Form of Humanity??refs, which exemplified humanity perfectly, so that similarity to the Form of 
Humanity would define how good one is at being human. However,
we can see that this solution is clearly unsatisfactory. First, the Forms are immaterial, so the Form of Humanity is 
immaterial, and hence it lacks fingers. Thus, the fewer fingers a human has, the more they are like the Form of
Humanity, and hence, absurdly, the more perfect they are. Second, if somehow the Form of Humanity ends up having 
body parts, then the Form of Humanity either has an even number of cells or an odd one. But clearly neither option
is more perfect than the other. 

Central to Plato's solution to cross-kind value comparisons is the self-exemplification of the Form of the Good:
the Form of the Good is itself maximally good. But a similar self-exemplifying Form cannot be used to account for
intra-kind comparisons. Aristotle, on the other hand, has the non-self-exemplifying forms immanent in things. 
The Aristotelian form of humanity specifies human perfection, but does not do so by exemplifying it. It has neither
fingers nor cells, but it \textit{specifies} that humans should have ten fingers while specifying an age-dependent
normal range of cell numbers rather than a specific cell count.

Notwithstanding the general falsity of Aquinas' comparison principle for degreed properties, Aquinas provides us
with a plausible extension of the Aristotelian system to allow for comparisons of degrees of good between objects
of different kinds in terms of the similarity to or degree of participation in a maximally good being, a divine being
that plays the role of a self-exemplifying Form of the Good. The human being participates in God in respect of
abstract intellectual activity, Aquinas will contend, while sparrows do not, and in that important respect, at least,
humans are more like God. On the other hand, the sparrow's movements approximate divine omnipresence better than 
the stillness of a mushroom does, and in that respect at least the sparrow is superior to the mushroom. We have,
thus, a ground for something like a great chain of being.

There are still difficulties here. While the human is superior in intellectual activity, the sparrow moves around
with greater three-dimensional freedom. How can we say that the human is superior all things considered? Where we
previously had a problem of cross-kind comparisons, we now have the problem of cross-attribute comparisons. 
Intuitively, the human's intellectual superiority to the sparrow trumps the sparrows motive superiority to the
human, and enables us to say that the human is more perfect on the whole. This higher level question is difficult
indeed. 

But there is some hope in thinking that in attributing different divine attributes we sometimes express divinity
to different degrees. It may be that there is no meaningful comparison between how well we express divinity by
saying that God is all-knowing versus by saying that God is all-powerful, saying that God knows the
multiplication table up to $10\times 10$ expresses divinity less well than saying that God can create any
possible physical reality. I suggested earlier that motion imitates divine omnipresence. Thus, the sparrow's
ability to fly imitates God's presence throughout several kilometers surrounding the surface of the earth, while
the human's more limited mobility imitates God's presence in a thin two meter shell of air surrounding that surface.
But the degreed difference between the two divine attributes---each a limited special case of omnipresence---imitated here 
might well be trumped by the fact that the sparrow does not imitate God's abstract intellectual activity \textit{at all}
while the human does imitate that activity, and does so in respect of a very wide scope of things (the human can think
abstractly about the whole universe, for instance). 

In ??backref, we gave a non-theistic Aristotelian sketch of a three-step great chain of being. The account here has
a hope of allowing one to fill in more intermediate links.
Even if the details in the comparisons between different attributes or respects do not work out, we still have an advantage 
for the theistic Aristotelian in being able to make cross-kind comparisons under specific respects, like motility or intelligence.

\subsection{Epistemology of normativity and form}\label{ch:epist-of-form}
[Argument: If a guided missile has form, it's alive by the Ch?? account of life. But it's not alive. So it lacks form. Is this a bad argument???]
\subsection{Ethics and happiness}

\subsection{Norms that fit with modern technology}
In ??backref, I argued that an ethics based on human form can simply ignore outlandish scenarios
that are far outside of our ecological niche, such as ones involving infinite numbers of
beneficiaries. However, there is a danger in this line of reasoning. As Arthur C. Clarke famously
said, ``Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.''??ref To human beings
50,000 years ago (or even just 500 years ago!) much of our technology would indeed be magical, and 
decisions that we routinely need to make, say in bioethics, would be predicated on outlandish assumptions. 

We might thus expect an ethics and epistemology grounded in a form possessed by hunter-gatherer primates
to be silent on dilemmas of a highly technological society, leaving us to do whatever we wish, or, even worse, 
to fail to harmonize with the shape of our lives, like that of a fish on land. Yet while there are, as there 
have always been, difficult and controversial moral and epistemological cases, we do not in fact find 
ourselves adrift without guidance in the modern world. Virtue continues to contribute to our flourishing,
and ancient texts, whether religious or philosophical, continue to point to good ways of living. 

This gives us reason to think that if our moral norms are grounded in human nature, human nature was somehow
picked out with foresight for what kinds of challenges humans would face in the distant future. Our ethics
does may not work in outlandish situations, such as those involving infinities as noted in ??backref, but it works in a
broader range of moral environments much broader than that found in early homo sapiens society. Thus, the theistic
version of our natural law theory both accounts for the apparent unsatisfactoriness of our ethics in situations that
humans apparently never find themselves with and the applicability in situations across a very wide range of situations,
wider and more technologically varied than the natural environment of other animals. This kind of foresight points to
a foreseer, indeed a designer, and hence towards a theistic version.

\section{Explaining harmony theistically}
\section{Explanations of moral norms}
\subsection{A pattern of ethical explanation}
Here is a familiar pattern. We have a deeply-seated moral intuition about the general prohibition, call it $g$, of some action,
such as incest. It is not clear how to derive the prohibition from intuitively more basic principles, such as one of 
the categorical imperatives. Easy considerations, which I will call the $c$s, show that in \textit{typical} cases the action is wrong,
but our moral intuition goes beyond these typical cases. Thus, considerations of the abuse of power, distortion of 
familial dynamics, and genetic harms show that most cases of incest are wrong, but it is easy to imagine cases
of incest to which these considerations do not apply---say, elderly siblings who were raised apart---and yet moral
intuition forbids incest in those cases as well.

We can now save the moral intuition by saying that the more general prohibition $g$ is simply a fundamental moral rule,
not reducible to the $c$s that explain why the action is wrong in typical cases. But if we stop
at this, the connection between $g$ and the $c$s mere happenstance, and that seems intuitively wrong. The abuse of 
power, distortion of family dynamics, and genetic harms should be relevant to why incest is wrong.

At this point, often we are in a position to see another fact: it is quite beneficial to have a 
general moral prohibition beyond the prohibitions arising from the $c$s. 

One reason for such a benefit from a general prohition could be that our judgment as to whether the $c$s apply to a given case is fallible, especially given our capacities
for self-deceit, and the costs of violating the $c$s are so high that it would be better for us to have a 
general prohibition than to try to judge things on a case-by-case basis. 

Second, in some examples of
the pattern, serious deliberation about the forbidden action can itself harm one or more of the goods
involved in the $c$s: thus, having to weigh whether the distortion-of-family-dynamics consideration
applies against a particular instance of incest can itself distort the agent's participation in family
dynamics. 

Third, we could have a tragedy of the commons situation. It could be that the $c$s are actually insufficient
to render an instance of the action wrong, but we would be better off as a society if we had general
abstention from the action. Thus, perhaps, the genetic harm coming from one more couple's engagement in incest
would be insufficiently significant to render the incest wrong, but without a general prohibition, incest
would be sufficiently widespread as to cause serious social problems. A general prohibition that is not
logically dependent on the $c$s would help avert such social harms.

These considerations are very familiar to us in the case of positive law. Jaywalking involves harms such as
disruption of traffic flow and the danger of death of the pedestrian and of trauma to the driver, and the
considerations of these make jaywalking wrong in typical cases. There are 
obvious instances, however, where these considerations do not apply: say, crossing a road where the pedestrian
can clearly see that there are no intersections or cars on the road for a significant distance in either 
direction. However, it may be better for people simply to abstain from jaywalking than judging whether the 
disruption and safety considerations apply on a case-by-case basis, because there could be so much harm if 
the judgment were to go wrong. As a result, it is can be reasonable for a state simply to ban jaywalking
altogether (or to ban it with some clear and easily adjudicated exceptions). We similarly resolve cases of
tragedy of the commons with positive law: think, for instance, about laws against littering.

In the case of positive law we have two different explanations. First, there is an explanation of why
the forbidden action is wrong in general: this is because it has been competently forbidden by legitimate authority.
This explanation need not make reference to considerations such as disruption of traffic flow or danger
of death.\footnote{Though in some cases \textit{some} such reference may be needed in order to establish
that the matter falls within the competence of the authority in question. Thus, a government agency may
be permitted to make rules on matters where traffic flow disruption is concerned.} Second, there is an 
explanation as to why the action has been forbidden by the authority---and here all the rich considerations
are relevant.

A theistic version of natural law can have precisely this pattern. An action is morally forbidden because
our nature is opposed to it. This explanatory fact does not make reference to the $c$s. But we still
have a further question to ask. The most obvious way to ask the question is to query why our nature 
includes this prohibition. But since our nature is essential to us, the answer to that question could 
simply be the necessary truth that we couldn't exist without this nature. However, we can put the question
in a slightly different way: Why are there intelligent primates on earth with a nature that includes this prohibition
rather than some other kind of intelligent primates with a nature that does not include this prohibition?
And here the theist can answer: Because it would be good, in light of the $c$s and the
further considerations in favor of generalizing the prohibition beyond the cases where the $c$s specifically
apply, to have intelligent primates with a nature that includes this prohibition, and God acted in light
of this good.\footnote{A divine command theorist can make the same move, but divine command theory has some
liabilities which were discussed in ??backref.}
