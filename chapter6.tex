\section{Multiple realizability}
Some conscious beings have brains. Start with the hypothesis that it is a necessary 
truth that all conscious beings have brains. 

First, this hypothesis is just implausible: it seems quite plausible that we could have
conscious beings with a very different body plans. 

Second, observe that brains are a specific type of organ in DNA-based animals.
To have a brain, thus, you need to have DNA. To have DNA, you need to have hydrogen
atoms. To have hydrogen atoms, you need to have electrons. A particle with a different 
electric charge would not be an electron, and the charge of the electron is definable in terms of 
the fine structure constant $e^2/(2\varepsilon_0 hc)$. If the fine structure constant
were different, we wouldn't have electrons. We might have shmelectrons that behave almost 
exactly like electrons, but they wouldn't be electrons. If we didn't have electrons, we wouldn't
have hydrogen, but at best shmydrogen. And if we didn't have hydrogen, we wouldn't have DNA,
but at best shmDNA. 

But now imagine a world extremely so similar to ours that no instruments of a sort
humans ever have a hope of constructing could ever tell the difference, but where, nonetheless,
the fine structure constant has a slightly different value. In that world we have beings that
behave, as far as any of us could ever tell by external and internal examination, just as we 
do. But they not only would \textit{be} unconscious zombies, they would \textit{have to be}
zombies---no beings with shmelectrons in place of electrons could be conscious on the hypothesis 
we are considering. That such a slight difference in physical constitution would make the
difference is extremely implausible. 

Third, if the hypothesis is true, we should be quite surprised at the existence
of consciousness. The argument just given shows that consciousness requires the precise value of
the fine structure constant that we have. How likely is that? Well, there are infinitely
many possible values that agree with our world's fine structure constant to within a thousand
significant figures. Unless our fine structure constant turns out to be some very special distinguished
value (for a while, some physicists thought it was exactly $1/137$??refs, but later measurements 
disproved that, and a recent estimate is $1/137.03599921$), the chances of getting the exact value
randomly we have is zero or at best infinitesimal. Given the fact that consciousness has great
value significance (??shvalue??), if consciousness depends on brains, and hence on electrons, then
the fact of consciousness would loudly cry out for explanation. 

The line of thought above is akin to fine-tuning arguments, where narrow ranges of fundamental constants
are claimed to be needed for life, and call out for explanation, with two options being typically offered:
a multiverse (unlikely things will happen if dice are rolled enough times) and an intelligent designer. But there are
some relevant differences in our present case. 

First, our range is much narrower---only one exact
value is compatible with consciousness on the hypothesis we are exploring---which means that objections from
the rescaling of ranges do not apply as they do in the case of the fine-tuning argument.??coarse-stuff 

Second, plausibly an intelligent designer
would be conscious, and if consciousness requires brains as we are hypothesizing, a designer will be of no help
here, on pain of circularity. 

Third, because the consciousness-permitting range has only one point on it, 
and there are uncountably infinitely many possible other values of the fine structure constant, hitting this value
will not automatically be probable even given a multiverse. If you spin a continuous fair spinner once, 
your chance of hitting a particular value is zero or infinitesimal. But the same is true for any finite number of independent spins.
Moreover, in classical probability theory, this is also true for a countably infinite number of spins. And for an
uncountably infinite number of spins, the probability is simply undefined. In light of this, the multiverse hypothesis only
really solves the problem of consciousness in our context if it is a Lewisian or Tegmarkian hypothesis that \textit{every} 
possible cosmic arrangement is realized in reality. But such a hypothesis only solves the problem at the expense of introducing serious
sceptical problems, since there will be cosmoses, just as real as ours, where every coherent sceptical hypothesis hold, and it does
not appear reasonable to think that we got so lucky as to escape them all.??refs

Tying consciousness to brains thus links consciousness to the precise laws of nature we have. That is not only intuitively implausible
but leads to serious problems. We should think that there is some flexibility in what kinds of bodies conscious beings can have.

Perhaps instead of supposing that consciousness is tied to brains, we could suppose that consciousness is tied to a range of brain-like
organs. Thus, consciousness would be compatible with having somewhat different laws of nature, resulting in fundamental particles
slightly different from the ones we have, and behavior somewhat different from the one we have, but not \textit{very} different.
But now consider the Mersenne questions about the boundaries of physical constitution compatible with consciousness. These
questions cannot be settled by invoking human nature, since they are questions that transcend the nature of any one species.
Nor can they be settled the way Mersenne settled his original questions, by invoking God's creative decision, because we are
supposing that the connection between consciousness and brain-like organs is necessary. We should avoid Mersenne questions that
do not seem to have a plausible answer. 

Furthermore, the issue of worlds practically indistinguishable to our instruments but where one has consciousness and the other
does not returns on the range view. Suppose that the upper cut-off for the fine structure constant to be compatible with
consciousness is $1/100$ (recall that our world's fine structure constant is about $1/137$). Then either $1/100$ is the
highest value compatible with consciousness or the lowest value incompatible with consciousness. If it is the highest value
compatible with consciousness, there should be a world $w_c$ with consciousness and fine-structure constant $1/100$ and a 
world $w_z$ that is practically indistinguishable from $w_c$ but where the fine-structure constant is slightly more than 
$1/100$ and hence where there are only zombies. If, on the other hand, $1/100$ is the lowest value incompatible with 
consciousness, then for a value of the fine-structure constant $(1/100)-\e$ for some positive $\e$ less than one divided by a 
googolplex there will be a world $w_c$ with consciousness. Then we should expect there to be a possible world $w_z$ with fine-structure constant
$1/100$ that is practically indistinguishable from $w_c$ (a difference of one in a googolplex should not affect anything observable),
but $w_z$ will be a zombie world, since we have assumed that a fine-structure constant of $1/100$ is incompatible with
consciousness. So in either case there will be a world with consciousness and a world with zombies which are physically
indistinguishable to humans.  But it is implausible that consciousness should depend on physical features that are so insignificant.

This line of thought pushes one to a liberal view about what kinds of physical constitutions are compatible with consciousness.
It does not appear, for instance, that consciousness should depend on having a physical constitution that includes brains or anything
similar to brains.
