\section{Natural relationships}
\subsection{Siblings and cousins}
An interesting test case for ethical theories is whether they can make good sense of our duties to our siblings and cousins. Duties to friends and spouses plausibly
arise from commitments we make. Duties to parents have traditionally been grounded in our obligation of gratitude for our life. Duties to children can
typically be grounded in the decision to perform actions that have a non-negligible probability of producing a person dependent on us. Duties to strangers
might be grounded in our shared rationality. But we owe more to our siblings and cousins than we do to strangers, even though typically we had no say in whether
we were to have siblings and cousins, and even when we have no favors to return. 

On utilitarianism, our duties to siblings and cousins come mainly from the contingent fact that we tend to be better positioned to do good to them, say because we know
their needs better, are likely to be physically closer, and help from us is likely to be more welcome. But if such contingencies are all that is involved, then we also
have to accept an error theory about our intuitions when they go beyond these contingencies. If a sibling or a stranger is drowning, other things being equal one should
try to rescue the sibling, even if the stranger is slightly easier to pull out, or is likely to have a slightly better future life. If one finds out that a local
homeless person is a cousin one has not seen since early childhood, it is more vicious to ignore their needs than to ignore similar need in a random stranger.
Murder of a stranger is evil, but fratricide is worse. 

In general, utilitarianism, contractarianism and Kantianism focus on the agent's rationality, taking the details of the agent's humanity to provide no direct normative 
input into ethical decisions. The fact that most humans hate eating mud gives one reason not to feed mud to them, and the fact that we are unable to instantly
teleport ensures we do not have the same obligation to those on other continents as to those nearby. But these are non-normative facts, and the normativity of the
conclusions here comes from general normative considerations applicable to all rational beings. There is some \textit{prima facie} plausibility to the idea
that the non-normative facts about the relationships between parents and children, together with normative facts applicable to all rational beings, could explain
distinctively filial and parental duties. But this is not plausible for the cases of siblings and cousins.

However, if we see ethics as based on the norms written into our \textit{human} nature, given a harmony between the rational and animal aspects of this humanity,
will very plausibly allow for distinctive ethical norms tied to particular kinds of natural human relationships, including perhaps in the first instance familial ones.
There is no need on our Natural Law ethics to derive the duties to cousins from non-normative facts about cousinhood and norms for all rational beings: such rules
can be fundamental. And the laws can, in principle, be at any level of precision, be it to simply consider one's siblings at a higher weight in one's moral calculus
than more distant relatives (we are all relatives, after all, as we learn from evolutionary theory) or to prefer one's siblings over one's cousins to such-and-such 
a specific degree. The laws could even have social construction built in: they could require us to respect our relatives in the ways that our society prescribes,
and require us to establish societies that institute ways for us to respect our relatives.

Divine command theory has a similar advantage: God's commands can be at any level of generality or precision, be it to love one's neighbor or to telephone one's cousins 
at least twice a year if one can. In principle, rule utilitarianism can do this as well: it is plausible that having rules concerning special relationships like
fraternal ones could maximize utility. But Natural Law arguably gives a better explanation of the duties tied to these special relationships. For the nature of these 
special relationships is very plausibly tied to our humanity, and hence it makes sense that the special obligations attached to them should flow from that humanity
rather than the commands of a God or the results of an abstract hypothetical optimization procedure. 

Indeed, on Aristotelian natural law, we can say that having these kinds of special obligations is an important aspect of what makes us human---for it is an important
aspect of our form, which is precisely what makes us human. 

\subsection{Less natural relationships}
We have a broad variety of socially-instituted and culturally-variable relationships which are very unlikely to have norms encoded 
for them in human nature.  In English-speaking countries the relationship to the  parent of one's godchild or the godparent of one's child
tends not to have sufficient importance to even have a name, while in other cultures it is important and specifically named. The relationship
between an employer and employee varies so broadly with legal and social structures that it is probably best seen as an umbrella for a number
of different relationships, none of which is likely to be encoded in human nature. 

Admittedly, a relationship could fail to be culturally widespread and yet could have norms encoded for it in human nature, but there is a more elegant approach to 
analyzing such relationship: we can see them as cultural determinations of a more fundamental relationship type, with some of the norms coming from human nature's
rules for the more fundamental relationship and others from the culture. Moreover, human nature may prescribe the scope for cultures to establish the rules.
Such relationships can be thought of as ``less natural''. At the same time, the difference between these relationships and the ``more natural'' ones like siblinghood
are likely to be largely of degree. For while there may be a fundamental normative relationship of siblinghood, it has further culturally-determined
norms.

\subsection{Marriage}
A particularly interesting question, of significant relevance to controversies in our society over the past century, is where \textit{marriage}
lies on the naturalness spectrum. I shall argue that it is likely to be quite natural, with a number of fundamental norms grounded in our human
nature by arguing against two main alternative theories and combinations of them.

The first theory holds that marriage is an institution defined by many human societies. Like other such social institutions, such as judgeship, parliament membership, 
monarchical sovereignty, exchequer chancellorship, and presidency, it is defined by the rights and obligations conferred by society on those who enter into the institution. 
While we use the same words ``judge'' and ``monarch'' across societies, there is only a family resemblance between the institutions these terms refer to, since the actual
rights and obligations defining the institutions are often very different indeed. The resemblance may be very weak: the rights and obligations of the monarch of England
in the 13th century are about as different from the rights and obligations of the current monarch as the rights and obligations of modern day judge are from a modern day
executioner. Nonetheless, for historical reasons we may use the same word ``monarch'', sometimes clarifying with adjectives like ``absolute'' or ``constitutional''.

The second theory has it that couples choose to undertake certain obligations with respect to each other, which obligations give rise to rights,
and this complex of rights and obligations defines the marriage. In more traditional societies, a couple may not choose the obligations specifically 
but rather will simply opt for the ``customary'' obligations and their consequent rights. In modern Western society, many couples write their own 
wedding vows, specifying general obligations. But even in those cases, it is likely that these vows are not typically thought of as a precise and exhaustive
legal contract, but rather as a way of customizing one of the prevalent packages of obligations. Again, on the individual theory, we use the same word 
``marriage'' for all these different packages of rights of obligations due to some sort of vague family resemblance between them. 

A more sophisticated theory??refs may combine aspects of the social and individual theories, holding that not only do couples undertake obligations to each other and gain
rights with respect to each other, they also undertake obligations to society and gain rights with respect to society. 

But the individual and social theories are unsatisfactory for multiple reasons.

\subsubsection{Travel}
Generally speaking, when a married couple emigrates to or visits another society, they are deemed married in their new place, unless there is some general reason that
precludes them from counting as married, such as when they are of the same sex and move to a jurisdiction that does not recognize same-sex marriage.

Moreover, this recognition of them as married is not just an honorific indexed to their country of origin. When the Queen of Denmark visited the United States in 1991,
she was referred to as a ``queen''??check, but obviously she did not have rights and obligations of a monarch with respect to the United States, and so ``queen''
here was indexed with respect to the Kingdom of Denmark, and similarly for the title ``prince'' held by her husband. However, if someone referred to Henrik 
as Margrethe's \textit{husband} or to Margreth as a \textit{married woman} during the visit, these terms would not be merely indexed to Denmark. Rather, they would
have the rights and obligations of an American married couple, as modified by their special immunity to persecution, and an ordinary non-diplomatic visitor from
Denmark would not even have that modification.

Should we say that by the mere fact of entering a country, a couple that was married in their country of origin enters into a new marriage institution?
On the social theory that is exactly what happens: the couple receives a new package of rights and obligations, definitive of marriage in a new society.
But this would be quite surprising: it would mean that a couple going for a honeymoon in another country would have had two weddings (one might tongue-in-cheek wonder if
theyn they shouldn't then be entitled to a second honeymoon?), and globetrotting couples would rack up marriage after marriage. Moreover, relinquishing one's
citizenship in a country one no longer lives in would be tantamount to a divorce. 

Or perhaps instead of the new institution being entered into upon entry into a country, a couple by marrying enters into the marriage institution of every
jurisdiction that is willing to recognize them as married, but the rights and obligations of these institutions are merely conditional on their being in
those countries. While this would alleviate the problem of multiple weddings, such automatic entry into institutions in states that have no jurisdiction over one seems implausible. 
Moreover, the problem of multiple weddings is not solved. When Margrethe and Henrik married in 1967, there was no state of East Timor. Then in
1975 it declared independence. By that declaration, did they impose a new marriage institution on Margrethe and Henrik, a marriage institution that disappeared
next year when East Timor was annexed by Indonesia, and then reappeared in 2002? 

On the purely individual theory, the travel problem disappears. Different states may add rights and obligations, but what defines the marriage is the 
complex of rights and obligations that the couple entered into on their own, and it counts as a ``marriage'' in their travel destination because of the
family resemblance between these rights and obligations and those that members of that society take on when they enter into an analogous relationship.

\section{A great chain of being and the definition of life}??move??
Here is an intuition that until fairly recently would have been widely shared: There are deep metaphysical divides between non-living and living things, 
and between merely living things and persons, and these divides mark a hierarchy of value, a chain of being. If we could defend such a divide, it would 
dovetail with the idea that persons are in an important way \textit{sacred}, having rights while other things have mere interests, if that. 

I want to offer a highly speculative Aristotelian reconstruction of this intuition. To introduce the reconstruction, start with a puzzle for
Aristotelian views. It seems that on such views:
\ditem{2-pursue-perfect}{Each thing naturally strives for its own perfections.}
\ditem{2-natural-activity}{The natural activity of a thing is a perfection of it.}
But this generates a regress. Let's say that reproduction is an oak tree's perfection. Then by \dref{2-pursue-perfect}, the oak tree naturally strives for 
reproduction. This natural activity of striving for reproduction, by \dref{2-natural-activity}, is then itself a perfection of the oak tree. Therefore,
by \dref{2-pursue-perfect}, the oak tree must naturally strive for it: hence the oak tree naturally strives for striving for reproduction. And so on,
\textit{ad infinitum}. But surely an oak tree does not pursue infinitely many things. And even after a few level of meta-striving we exhaust plausibility.

I suggest that we can deny \dref{2-pursue-perfect}. Some perfections of a thing are not actually naturally striven for by the thing.\footnote{An interesting
theological example may be the idea in the Thomistic tradition that both the beatific vision and our striving for it are gifts of God's grace, rather than
natural for us, even though the beatific vision perfects us.??} The oak tree does strive for reproduction with its reproductive organs. Moreover, it has a 
second order striving: it strives to strive for reproduction, by growing the reproductive organs with which it strives for reproduction. There may be one or
two more meta-levels, but at some level we can say: it just does this, without striving to do it.

Non-living things, on an Aristotelian metaphysics, also have form and also strive for ends. But plausibly they don't strive to strive: they just strive. 
We thus have a hierarchical division between inorganic things which do not strive to strive and living things which have second order teleological strivings.

The problem of the definition of life is a thorny conceptual problem in biology or its philosophy. Different authors give different lists of features such 
as homeostasis, growth and reproduction as part of the definition of life. The multiplicity of features listed makes the concept of life seem arbitrary.
Moreover, it is philosophically problematic to tie the the concept of life too tightly to the physical forms of life around us. For it is very plausible
that if there are immaterial agents such as deities, spirits or angels, they should also count as alive.\footnote{It is worth noting that not everyone who
believes in deities, spirits or angels believes them to be immaterial. The ancient Greeks did not think their deities immaterial. And a minority opinion
among Christian theologians held angels to be made of ``subtle matter''.??ref But the argument only needs that some do believe them to be immaterial.}
 After all, those who believe in such beings sometimes 
hold them to be immortal. But if they were not alive, their immortality would be a trivial claim: a being that is not alive in the first place cannot die. 
However, these beings are conceptualized as alive, even when they cannot engage in homeostasis, growth or reproduction. And yet while a particular existence
claim about the existence of immortal immaterial agents might be false, it does not seem to be fundamentally conceptually confused. Thus, a good account
of life should include the kind of life that is attributed to immaterial agents, and none??check of the accounts in the philosophy of biology do that.

Furthermore, it is a merit of a definition that when applied to cases where we do not know how to classify a thing, the definition does not trivially
decide the issue, but it points to the question we need to answer if we are to decide the issue. To that end, consider two borderline cases: viruses
and sophisticated robots, like Star Trek's Data. In neither case are we confident whether we have life. Viruses are famously a borderline case.
And while Data is described as a ``synthetic life-form''??ref, and the Star Trek canon clearly favors his being actually alive, the question is
not so philosophically clear. Data obviously fails typical biological definitions of life: while he engages in self-maintenance, he doesn't grow or
reproduce in the biological sense of the word (though he does make other androids), in a way that does not match typical viewers' intuitions.\footnote{Though,
admittedly, there may be some static due to the show confusing the question of consciousness with that of life.??check} And 
whether a virus qualifies as alive varies from definition
to definition??ref in a way that makes it sound like the question of viruses being alive is merely verbal. Yet given the strong intuition that there
is something of great value about life, even something sacred, the question of what is and is not alive should not be merely verbal. 

On the other hand, an account on which what it is to be alive is to have a second order teleological striving---to strive to strive for a perfection---will nicely 
include any immaterial agents. It will include any entity that prepares itself for future teleological activity, say by growth,
and hence will include all the physical forms of life we know about. It will exclude elementary particles. And whether it includes viruses or sophisticated
robots is unclear---as it should be. For it is unclear whether viruses and sophisticated robots have form at all. If viruses have form, then it is likely
that their activity of attaching to hosts for purposes of future replication is a striving for replicative striving, and hence they are alive. But it is
not clear whether they have form. If sophisticated robots have form, they also exhibit meta-striving, and hence are alive. But in both cases we do not
know whether there is form, or whether we are dealing with a mere agglomeration of particles. 
Aristotle himself seems to have thought that
artifacts only had form in the analogical sense of a blueprint in the mind of the designer??ref, but he could have been wrong in the case of artifacts like Data.
(For more on the epistemic issues here, see Section~\ref{sec:epist-of-form}
in Chapter~\ref{ch:God}.) 

We thus have two levels in a chain of being: things that strive but don't meta-strive, and things that meta-strive. Now, among the things that meta-strive,
we can describe a higher kind of thing: a thing that strives for all of its perfections. The premises of the regress argument with which we started this
section apply to such a being. Thus, this is a being that strives for striving for ... for perfection, at any number of levels. While this is implausible
for an oak tree or even a dog, we do actually know of one kind of being that does that: humans. Human beings not only conceptualize particular perfections, such as friendship
or striving for striving for health, but they conceptual perfection as such, and strive for it as such. If a trustworthy being offered you to increase
some perfection or other, and assured you that you would in no way be harmed, it would be rational for you to accept the offer, because perfection as
such is one of the things you and I pursue. 

At the same time, in a minded being, the infinite chain that results from striving for all one's perfections need not be a chain of separate desires
and hence does not require a being that is actually infinite. Rather, all that's needed is for the being to be such that it has or teleologically strives 
to have the concept of a perfection as such and a desire for perfection as such. This desire then can manifest in a striving to figure out what the perfections are---a striving that is central to
the search for happiness (\textit{eudaimonia}) that was so characteristic of Socratic and post-Socratic Greek philosophy---and a striving to be ready
to accept whatever one finds. In fact, it might be that for reasons having to do with the nature of infinity \textit{only} a minded being can pursue
an infinite number of ends---for any non-minded being that did that would need to have infinitely many distinct causal sources of its activity in 
a way that might well violate causal finitism, the thesis that it is impossible for an infinite number of causes to work together (for a defense
of causal finitism, see ??ref). And among minded beings, perhaps it is definitive of \textit{persons} that they pursue all good.

We thus have a qualitative hierarchy of being between the mere strivers, the mere meta-strivers and the universal strivers. The first division in
the hierarchy may well correspond to that between the non-living and the living, and the second might---depending on speculative questions about
infinity---align with the division between mere life and personhood. And it is very natural to see qualitative divisions of value here as well.
