\section{Introduction}
\section{Teleological reductions}
\subsection{A multiplicity of concepts}
The applications above, and the Aristotelian tradition, make use of various normative concepts that are said to be grounded in forms,
such as proper function, teleology, and flourishing. It would be good to investigate if these 
can be further unified, under either one of these concepts, or some further unifying concept.

First, observe that we have both binary and comparative normative concepts, often in the same context.
Suppose a stranger is about to be hit by a train, and the only four options are:

\ditem{kick}{give them a kick to ensure that they have no chance of survival}
\ditem{fun}{make fun of them}
\ditem{idle}{stand by idly}
\ditem{jump}{jump in and push them out of the way likely at the cost of one's own life.} 

The binary distinction is that
the first two options are impermissible, and the other two are permissible. But there is a comparative distinction
as well: \dref{kick} is worse than \dref{fun}, and \dref{jump} is better than \dref{idle}. The binary distinction does not reduce to
degree of comparison: while \dref{fun} is much worse than \dref{idle}, \dref{idle} is much worse than \dref{jump} (though 
it is more natural to say that \dref{jump} is much better than \dref{idle}). And the comparisons do not reduce to the binary 
characterizations.

Proper function and teleology appear to be primarily binary concepts: a thing functions properly or improperly, and a thing either 
does or does not achieve its end. Flourishing, on the other hand, seems to comprise both the binary and the comparative. The mildly
vicious person unjustly suffering horrendous pain appears not to be flourishing \textit{simpliciter}, but if the pain were increased,
they would languish more. Flourishing thus appears the best candidate for a foundational concept for our norms.

But because the notion of ends and teleology has been so important in the Aristotelian tradition, both in the case of voluntary 
action and involuntary activity, it is worth thinking some more about ends.

\subsection{Ends}
Many activities seem to occur for an end. The activity then counts as successful provided that the end occurs and occurs as a
fulfillment of the activity. An organism produces gametes in order to reproduce. A cat chases birds in order to catch them,
and eats them for nourishment. And I put on shoes to keep my feet comfortable when I walk. The end-directedness of much voluntary
activity is obvious, but whether there really is teleology in the involuntary cases is more controversial, though highly intuitive.

The Aristotelian tradition tends to analyze voluntary action as always end-directed, but also tends to see involuntary activity as 
often, if not always, directed at an end. I will argue, starting with the case of voluntary action, that many interesting phenomena 
would be misclassified as end-directed. The actual structure can be more complex, and while it has a directional structure, it is
misleading to think of that structure as teleological in the sense of possessing a \textit{telos}, an end that fulfills it.

Consider a sprinter who is running a hundred meters all out against a clock, rather than against other opponents. The runner has an end, 
namely to sprint 100 meters. But sprinting 100 meters does not explain the intense effort the runner puts in. Less than half of the effort 
could have been put in, and 100 meters would still have been sprinted. The bulk of the runner's effort is explained by being directed 
not at completing the sprint but at completing it in minimum time.

But what state of affairs does the runner's speed-directed effort have as its end? A runner might have a particular target time in mind.
However, we are imagining a runner who runs all out. A runner who is just aiming at a particular time could slow down if it became obvious
that a slower run would still achieve the target time, but not so our all-out runner. Our sprinter may have some specific time in mind
to motivate themselves, but interpreting their action as merely aiming at that time does not capture all of the directional structure 
of the performance. Any shortening of the time of the run is welcome given the sprinter's aims. 

We would normally describe the runner as trying to run 100 meters ``as fast as possible'', and that seems to be a coherent description
of an end. However, the language of ``as fast possible'' should not be taken literally. First, we have the question of what the relevant
comparison class is. Is the runner trying to run as fast as any human being can on any track? As fast as they themselves can run on this
track on this occasion? Or something in between? ??? unlikely success!

Second, suppose we fix a particular sense of ``as fast as possible'', and then after ten meters the runner realizes that they have
been slightly slower than is possible. At this point, it is no longer possible for the runner to achieve the goal of literally running
the run as fast as possible. But we do not expect the runner to stop. We expect the runner to resume running all-out, as part of the
same directed activity.

\section{Individual forms}
Recall the debate whether forms are individual---numerically different ones for different members of the same kind---or shared
by all members of the same kind.

In ??backref, we saw that there is some advantage to an individual form account of ethics: individual forms intuitively do 
a little more justice to the personal nature of ethical obligation.??[but conjoint twins] ??add 
But are there any other arguments for taking forms to be individual?

I believe so. An initial attempt might be to argue that then the numerically same entity---the form---is present in multiple
places at once. I do not find this argument compelling, however, as I do not think multilocation is absurd.??ref But if you
do, that is one argument. Let us consider some others.

\subsection{Distant conspecifics}
Suppose a shared form theory is true. Now, imagine that in our galaxy there is only one human being, Adam, and imagine that in 
a galaxy far, far away, God creates a humanoid comes into existence, with no genetic connection to Adam, but with a form that 
is just like Adam's: this form unifies matter in the same way as
Adam's form does, it imposes exactly the same norms on the form's owner as the human form does on Adam, and it causes the same
structure and behavior as the human form does for Adam. 

At this point we have a dilemma: either the form of this humanoid must be numerically the same as Adam's or not. Suppose it 
must be numerically the same as ours. Then somehow simply by creating something in a galaxy far, far away, God causes an
entity in \textit{our} galaxy---Adam's form---to become multilocated. This seems counterintuitive. 

Suppose that the form does not need to be numerically the same as Adam's. In that case, we have admitted that there can 
be numerically different forms with the same broadly functional features (including the normative functions). This 
means that the question of whether you and I have the  numerically same form is not settled by noting that the forms have 
the same functional features. Indeed, now the question whether your and my form is numerically different or the same becomes
a metaphysical question that no empirical data is relevant to the settling of. There is nothing absurd about there being
such metaphysical questions. But it is some advantage to a theory if raises fewer such questions, having fewer degrees of 
freedom. And if one does accept a theory where it is possible but not logically necessary that different individual substances
have numerically different forms, then one really shouldn't be accepting that in practice you and I share a form. At best
one should be agnostic on this question.

\subsection{Ethical counting}
...forms are the most important, so why not count by forms rather than individuals, especially in cross-species contextst??
