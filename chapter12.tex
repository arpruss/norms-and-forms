\section{Introduction}
\section{Teleological reductions}
The applications above made use of various normative concepts that were said to be grounded in forms:
norms of various sorts, proper function, teleology, and flourishing. It would be good to investigate if these 
can be further unified, under either one of these concepts, or some further unifying concept.

First, observe that we have both binary and comparative normative concepts, often in the same context.
Suppose a stranger is about to be hit by a train, and the only four options are:

\ditem{kick}{give them a kick to ensure that they have no chance of survival}
\ditem{fun}{make fun of them}
\ditem{idle}{stand by idly}
\ditem{jump}{jump in and push them out of the way likely at the cost of one's own life.} 

The binary distinction is that
the first two options are impermissible, and the other two are permissible. But there is a comparative distinction
as well: \dref{kick} is worse than \dref{fun}, and \dref{jump} is better than \dref{idle}. The binary distinction does not reduce to
degree of comparison: while \dref{fun} is much worse than \dref{idle}, \dref{idle} is much worse than \dref{jump} (though 
it is more natural to say that \dref{jump} is much better than \dref{idle}). And the comparisons do not reduce to the binary 
characterizations.

Proper function and teleology appear to be primarily binary concepts: a thing functions properly or improperly, and a thing either 
does or does not achieve its end. Flourishing, on the other hand, seems to comprise both the binary and the comparative. The mildly
vicious person unjustly suffering horrendous pain appears not to be flourishing \textit{simpliciter}, but if the pain were increased,
they would languish more.

\section{Individual forms}
Recall the debate whether forms are individual---numerically different ones for different members of the same kind---or shared
by all members of the same kind.

In ??backref, we saw that there is some advantage to an individual form account of ethics: individual forms intuitively do 
a little more justice to the personal nature of ethical obligation.??[but conjoint twins] ??add 
But are there any other arguments for taking forms to be individual?

I believe so. An initial attempt might be to argue that then the numerically same entity---the form---is present in multiple
places at once. I do not find this argument compelling, however, as I do not think multilocation is absurd.??ref But if you
do, that is one argument. Let us consider some others.

\subsection{Distant conspecifics}
Suppose a shared form theory is true. Now, imagine that in our galaxy there is only one human being, Adam, and imagine that in 
a galaxy far, far away, God creates a humanoid comes into existence, with no genetic connection to Adam, but with a form that 
is just like Adam's: this form unifies matter in the same way as
Adam's form does, it imposes exactly the same norms on the form's owner as the human form does on Adam, and it causes the same
structure and behavior as the human form does for Adam. 

At this point we have a dilemma: either the form of this humanoid must be numerically the same as Adam's or not. Suppose it 
must be numerically the same as ours. Then somehow simply by creating something in a galaxy far, far away, God causes an
entity in \textit{our} galaxy---Adam's form---to become multilocated. This seems counterintuitive. 

Suppose that the form does not need to be numerically the same as Adam's. In that case, we have admitted that there can 
be numerically different forms with the same broadly functional features (including the normative functions). This 
means that the question of whether you and I have the  numerically same form is not settled by noting that the forms have 
the same functional features. Indeed, now the question whether your and my form is numerically different or the same becomes
a metaphysical question that no empirical data is relevant to the settling of. There is nothing absurd about there being
such metaphysical questions. But it is some advantage to a theory if raises fewer such questions, having fewer degrees of 
freedom. And if one does accept a theory where it is possible but not logically necessary that different individual substances
have numerically different forms, then one really shouldn't be accepting that in practice you and I share a form. At best
one should be agnostic on this question.

\subsection{Ethical counting}
...forms are the most important, so why not count by forms rather than individuals, especially in cross-species contextst??
