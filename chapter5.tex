\section{Balancing doxastic desiderata}
I observe one raven, and it's black. I observe another and it's black, too. The story goes on. Every
raven I observe is black. After a certain number of ravens, in a sufficiently broad number of settings,
it becomes reasonable to believe that all ravens are black. But when?\footnote{I am grateful to Sherif Girgis for raising the issue of incommensurable desiderata in connection with these issues.}

William James famously identified two incommensurable doxastic desiderata: attainment of truth and avoidance of falsehood.
The larger the number of black ravens that are needed for me to believe that all ravens are black, the more surely
I avoid falsehood, but the more slowly I attain truth. Intuitively, there is room for differences between reasonable
people: some tend to jump to conclusions more quickly, while others are more apt to suspend judgment. But on either
extreme, eventually we reach unreasonableness. Both someone who concludes that all ravens are black based on one 
observation and someone who continues to suspend judgment after a million broadly spread observations are unreasonable.

There is, thus, a range of reasonable levels of evidence for an inductive belief. And, as in the myriad of ethical
cases of Chapter~\ref{ch:ethics}, this raises the Mersenne question: What grounds facts about the minimum amount of 
evidence required for an inductive inference and the maximum amount at which suspending judgment is still rational? 
Of course, the ``minimum'' and ``maximum'' may may depend on the subject matter, on higher-order evidence such as about 
how well previous inductive generalizations have fared, and even on pragmatic factors(??ref). But that added complexity does
nothing to make the Mersenne question easier to answer. And, as we discussed in ??backref, invoking vagueness does not
solve the problem, but multiplies the complexity even further.

And, of course, my contention will be that conformity to the human form is what grounds the answers for us. The
rational way to reason is the way conforms to our form's specification of the proper functioning of our intellect.

It appears to be quite plausible that different answers to the rationality questions would be appropriate
for species of rational animals adapted to different environments. First, some possible worlds as a whole have 
laws of nature implying a greater uniformity than that found in other worlds, and hence make it appropriate to make 
inductive inferences more quickly. Second, the environments that the rational animals evolved in may have greater or 
lesser uniformity, despite the same laws of nature. Third, the ecological niche occupied by the rational animals may
punish falsehood more or may reward truth more. ??explain with examples  Because of this, the Aristotelian 
species-relative answer to the Mersenne questions is particularly appealing.

\section{Logics of induction}
Attempts have been made to give precise answers to the questions about the reasonableness of inductive 
inferences using a rigorously formulated logics of induction.??refs Let us suppose, first, that some such
logic, call it $L_{12}$, does indeed embody the correct answers. Nonetheless, we will have a Mersenne question
as to why $L_{12}$, rather than one of the many alternatives, is the logic by which we ought to reason 
inductively. 

In the truthfunctional deductive case, there is a system that appears to be both particularly natural and matches
our intuitions so well that it has gained a nearly universal following among philosophers, logicians, mathematicians
and computer scientists: two-valued boolean logic. It is a sociological fact that no logic of induction has anything
like this following, and a plausible explanation of this sociological fact is that no logic of induction has the kind
of naturalness and fit with intuition that would privilege it over the others to a degree where it would seem
non-arbitrary to say that it is \textit{the} logic we should reason with.

Further, observe that logics of induction can be divided into two categories: those with parameters (say, 
parameters controlling the speed of inductive inference--??refs) and those without. 

A logic of induction with parameters raises immediate Mersenne problems about what grounds the fact about which 
parameters, or ranges of parameters, are in fact rationally correct. 

A parameter-free logic of induction, however, is not likely to do justice to the fact that different ways of balancing
rational goods are appropriate in different epistemic and pragmatic contexts. Moreover, it is unlikely to do justice
to the intuition that the balancing should be different in different species of rational agents.
