\subsection{Avoiding radical scepticism}
%% The threat of saturated nonmeasurable sets and brute facts can be avoided if we OUGHT to have low priors for them.
%% But being such that we ought to have low priors for something that is a not unlikely possibility given the causal structure
%% of the world undercuts knowledge. So we need a cooperative causal structure of the world.
\section{Explaining harmony theistically}
\section{Explanations of moral norms}
\subsection{A pattern of ethical explanation}
Here is a familiar pattern. We have a deeply-seated moral intuition about the general prohibition, call it $g$, of some action,
such as incest. It is not clear how to derive the prohibition from intuitively more basic principles, such as one of 
the categorical imperatives. Easy considerations, which I will call the $c$s, show that in \textit{typical} cases the action is wrong,
but our moral intuition goes beyond these typical cases. Thus, considerations of the abuse of power, distortion of 
familial dynamics, and genetic harms show that most cases of incest are wrong, but it is easy to imagine cases
of incest to which these considerations do not apply---say, elderly siblings who were raised apart---and yet moral
intuition forbids incest in those cases as well.

We can now save the moral intuition by saying that the more general prohibition $g$ is simply a fundamental moral rule,
not reducible to the $c$s that explain why the action is wrong in typical cases. But if we stop
at this, the connection between $g$ and the $c$s mere happenstance, and that seems intuitively wrong. The abuse of 
power, distortion of family dynamics, and genetic harms should be relevant to why incest is wrong.

At this point, often we are in a position to see another fact: it is quite beneficial to have a 
general moral prohibition beyond the prohibitions arising from the $c$s. 

One reason for such a benefit from a general prohition could be that our judgment as to whether the $c$s apply to a given case is fallible, especially given our capacities
for self-deceit, and the costs of violating the $c$s are so high that it would be better for us to have a 
general prohibition than to try to judge things on a case-by-case basis. 

Second, in some examples of
the pattern, serious deliberation about the forbidden action can itself harm one or more of the goods
involved in the $c$s: thus, having to weigh whether the distortion-of-family-dynamics consideration
applies against a particular instance of incest can itself distort the agent's participation in family
dynamics. 

Third, we could have a tragedy of the commons situation. It could be that the $c$s are actually insufficient
to render an instance of the action wrong, but we would be better off as a society if we had general
abstention from the action. Thus, perhaps, the genetic harm coming from one more couple's engagement in incest
would be insufficiently significant to render the incest wrong, but without a general prohibition, incest
would be sufficiently widespread as to cause serious social problems. A general prohibition that is not
logically dependent on the $c$s would help avert such social harms.

These considerations are very familiar to us in the case of positive law. Jaywalking involves harms such as
disruption of traffic flow and the danger of death of the pedestrian and of trauma to the driver, and the
considerations of these make jaywalking wrong in typical cases. There are 
obvious instances, however, where these considerations do not apply: say, crossing a road where the pedestrian
can clearly see that there are no intersections or cars on the road for a significant distance in either 
direction. However, it may be better for people simply to abstain from jaywalking than judging whether the 
disruption and safety considerations apply on a case-by-case basis, because there could be so much harm if 
the judgment were to go wrong. As a result, it is can be reasonable for a state simply to ban jaywalking
altogether (or to ban it with some clear and easily adjudicated exceptions). We similarly resolve cases of
tragedy of the commons with positive law: think, for instance, about laws against littering.

In the case of positive law we have two different explanations. First, there is an explanation of why
the forbidden action is wrong in general: this is because it has been competently forbidden by legitimate authority.
This explanation need not make reference to considerations such as disruption of traffic flow or danger
of death.\footnote{Though in some cases \textit{some} such reference may be needed in order to establish
that the matter falls within the competence of the authority in question. Thus, a government agency may
be permitted to make rules on matters where traffic flow disruption is concerned.} Second, there is an 
explanation as to why the action has been forbidden by the authority---and here all the rich considerations
are relevant.

A theistic version of natural law can have precisely this pattern. An action is morally forbidden because
our nature is opposed to it. This explanatory fact does not make reference to the $c$s. But we still
have a further question to ask. The most obvious way to ask the question is to query why our nature 
includes this prohibition. But since our nature is essential to us, the answer to that question could 
simply be the necessary truth that we couldn't exist without this nature. However, we can put the question
in a slightly different way: Why are there intelligent primates on earth with a nature that includes this prohibition
rather than some other kind of intelligent primates with a nature that does not include this prohibition?
And here the theist can answer: Because it would be good, in light of the $c$s and the
further considerations in favor of generalizing the prohibition beyond the cases where the $c$s specifically
apply, to have intelligent primates with a nature that includes this prohibition, and God acted in light
of this good.\footnote{A divine command theorist can make the same move, but divine command theory has some
liabilities which were discussed in ??backref.}
